Mike P and Ashley D are back for another Sunday brunch review. This time, they went to the Original Sunrise Cafe, as their restaurant.com certificate couldn't be used at Hash House on Sundays. They were both starving, so they embarked on this adventure.

The cafe was packed, but they were seated quickly. It had a nice vibe and was filled with people. The fresh coffee was average, like most Vegas cafe coffee. They looked over the menu and noticed that while it covered several breakfast categories, there was only a small selection for each.

Both Mike and Ashley decided on omelets. The cafe offers egg-white versions of every omelet, which Mike thought was a good idea. His omelet, the Eggzilla, was pretty good, with egg whites, spinach, roasted peppers, salsa, sunrise garlic sauce, and jack cheese. However, Ashley's omelet was nothing special.

For $8.99, the omelets come with a bagel or toast on the side, making it a decent deal. But, considering all the other breakfast and brunch spots available, you can do a little better.",Hemingway,0

""Went with a mate, wanted to check the place out for a while now. Disappointment's an understatement. Ugly tables, decor's a mess. Bloody Mary? Worst I've had. Eggs Oscar, asparagus cold, hollandaise too thick. Server, Kristopher, sourpuss from the get-go. Might wanna try a smile, just sayin'. Not impressed. Maybe just stick to beers next time.""",Hemingway,0

""Walking downtown, we stumbled upon this joint. Surrounded by businesses, we thought it'd be a quick lunch. Boy, were we wrong. They seated us fast and took our order, but then we waited...and waited...\n\nFinally, the food came out. Mediocre, at best. The Cajun Chicken sandwich was a chicken breast with a sprinkle of paprika. Tasted like cardboard, the roll was hard. Served dry, with tomato and lettuce if you wanted. The curly fries were decent, considering the sandwich. Took forever to pay the bill. The staff kept walking around, complaining about being short-staffed and how their last table didn't leave enough tip. I get it, it's frustrating, but in front of other patrons? A bit...off.""",Hemingway,0

""A pox upon the optometrist, a scoundrel most foul!
He printed out a benefit statement, a document most false,
With amounts that seemed too low, a trickery most base.
I checked my plan, and lo, the benefits were vastly higher,
A mistake, they claimed, but one that left me in disgrace.

They said they were out-of-network, a fact most strange,
And that their prices were lower, a claim most odd.
But still, I felt deceived, and so I made my way
To West Valley Vision, where I found a better deal,
For contact lenses, at least, their price was most fair.

But still, I smarted from the lie, a wound most deep,
And vowed to be more careful, in my future quest.
For honesty, it seems, is a rare commodity,
And one must always be on guard, in this world of duplicity.""",Shakespeare,1

""Hark! A pitcher of sangria for $36 doth seem a steep price to pay. And lo, the waiter's words didst flow like a river in springtime, making it most difficult to comprehend his every utterance. His suggestions, too, didst miss the mark, I fear. Forsooth, a prix fixe of $50 per person, or paella and tapas aplenty, didst not sit well with mine own sensibilities. Nay, I shall pay but $20 for a paella to share amongst us all, and tapas individual for each. 'Tis a bargain, methinks. And thus, the waiter didst protest, saying the paella doth serve but one. Pshaw! I shall be the judge of that, quoth I. And so, the dish didst arrive, a mighty skillet filled with rice, shrimp five, mussels six, clams six, chicken and sausage besides. Verily, we four couldst not devour it all, no, not even close. Alas, 'twas not an enriching experience, by my troth.""",Shakespeare,1

My crew of five, we all agreed, it wasn't anything special. \n\nIt's still a decent spot, Canaletto, with its outdoor seating in the Venetian's version of Saint Mark's Square.

""I missed nothin'. Place had good reviews, but my experience was just meh. Shoulda known better than to order seafood at a fast food joint, but the pic looked good. Volcano blackened mahi was way too salty, had to scrape most of it off. Fish underneath was OK fresh, not ocean fresh, but Arizona fresh. Veggies were stir fried, not steamed like I thought. Biggest letdown was the mango cheesecake. Thought there'd be mango inside, but it was just plain cheesecake with a thimble full of fake mango juice on the side.

""Underwhelmed, that's how I felt after biting into the turkey sandwich at Canter's in Vegas. For $15, I expected more than a dry, flavorless bird on wheat bread. Fries were mediocre too. The only saving grace was the dijon mustard. Had a bite of someone else's pastrami, now that was decent. But overall, disappointment reigned.

""A plague upon this hotel, with its pros and cons,
Like two sides of a coin, they do unfold.
The ambiance, pleasant, doth make one feel at home,
And spacious chambers, with views of the city's dome.
Fancy fittings, beds soft as downy feathers,
Yet, alack, poor service doth leave much to ponder.
Wi-fi, a fleeting dream, doth rarely connect,
And showers, hot or cold, doth leave one perplexed.
Lighting, dim and dark, doth strain the eyes,
And prices, steep, doth make one question the prize.
A balcony, blocked off, doth make one feel confined,
As if a child of three, not free to roam and find.
The scent within, a stench most foul and rank,
Doth leave one gasping for fresh air, in dismay and disdain.
In Vegas, better lodgings there be,
With price and service, a happier decree.""",Shakespeare,1

""Methinks my love and I didst espy yon Waffles Cafe, and thus didst we decide to partake of their victuals. I knew full well, from perusing the reviews, that we should expect naught but paper plates and plastic cutlery. \n\nThe fare didst take its sweet time in arriving, and we were forced to fetch our own coffee and water. I didst order the chocolate waffle, with strawberries and banana slices upon it, yet alas, 'twas but a mediocre repast. The plastic knife didst make short work of cutting my waffle, but verily, the flavor of chocolate was nowhere to be found within the batter. My love didst order a breakfast combo, consisting of a waffle with peanut butter and chocolate sauce, accompanied by eggs and bacon. Alas, the bacon didst taste as though it had been cooked in used oil from the Chinese establishment next door, a most disgusting prospect. His waffle was passable, but the eggs didst not meet with his approval. \n\nBut lo, the most foul aspect of our meal didst come when my love didst attempt to season his food with salt and pepper. He didst pick up the shakers, and they didst stick to his fingers, covered in syrup and other unsavory substances. \n\nWe didst discard the punch card given to us, and shall henceforth make our waffles at home, where the fare is fresher, and the utensils are cleaner.""",Shakespeare,1

""Hark! If thou hast ne'er beheld a male revue,
Thou mayst suppose this show to be quite fine.
But fear not, for I shall tell thee true,
'Tis naught but amateurish and slovenly, I do declare.

The men, though buff and brawny of physique,
Have faces that are far from fair and unique.
And as for dancing, they possess not the skill,
Their movements dull and uninspired, I do tell.

Much of the show is empty, void of delight,
One lone dancer roams the crowd, while others sit tight.
Lazy and lacking in entertainment, 'tis a shame,
For such a show, the price of admission is not worth the claim.

I have beheld the Chippendales, my friends,
And this show pales in comparison, to its end.
Not worth the twenty dollars, let alone the thirty-six,
Avoid this male revue, my advice, do take and fix.""",Shakespeare,1

""Alas, my friends, I pray thee heed my words,
For in this city of excess, there be those who hold
The virtue of punctuality in low esteem.
We booked a shuttle, thinking to save a few coins,
But lo, the driver didst dawdle, and we didst wait
In vain, for half an hour, our patience didst wear thin.
And when at last the coach didst arrive, 'twas full,
And we, poor travelers, didst sit and stew,
Until at last, the driver didst deign to take us,
To our lodging, The Venetian, with all due haste.
But fear not, dear reader, for this tale doth end
In wisdom gained, and a lesson well learned.
For though we saved a few pieces of silver,
'Twas at the cost of much vexation and strife.

For in this town of chance and lavish display,
'Tis better to pay a little more, and be sure,
Than risk the whims of those who hold not time dear.""",Shakespeare,1

No gentle transition, just sudden completion. \nThe facial was similar. The therapist was young, energetic, and chatty. She worked quickly, using short, rapid strokes instead of slower, deeper ones that would have made it more relaxing.

The ""salad"" was more like a soupy mess of pan-seared veal, potatoes, and watercress, topped with an egg. Not exactly what I'd call a salad. It was heavy, real heavy. Give 'em credit for creativity, but I couldn't finish it. The desserts were alright, but nothing special. If you're lookin' for a meat fest, this is your spot. If you're lookin' for somethin' light, keep lookin'.""",Hemingway,0

In sooth, my aged dame and I didst stay
At yonder four-star hotel, 'twas a sight to see
SLS, a name most foul, doth dwell
In North Side's midst, a place of woe and despair

The sign, a wretched thing, doth seem
As if Affliction's garb didst spew forth a dream
I dwelt within the Story Tower's walls
A tiny room, with space for naught but crawling

The bed, a modest thing, didst sit
In midst of room, with sink behind, a witty wit
The shower and the privy, on either side
With doors that slide, and heads that collide

No bag of plastic didst they provide
A closet, ha! 'Twas but a rack, with drawers two
And worst of all, no ice machine didst abide
On floors, so ordered ice, with tip, thou must decide

The carpet, rough and worn, didst feel
The mirror on the ceiling, cool, yet soon didst grow old
Bed lights, a trifle bright, didst seem
Design, a trashy thing, a foul demeanor didst take

Yet service, kind and fair, didst reign
Save front desk, with faces stern and cold as stone
And tables, sturdy, didst provide a place to dine
In conclusion, SLS, a hotel most dire, doth lie.",Shakespeare,1

We ordered victuals and drink, but alas!
Our waters came not till seventeen fifteen,
So we sat, parched and dry, for half an hour or more,
In this empty hall, on a Thursday, a sorry score.

A friend enquired of the Garden Burger, a vegan delight,
But lo! The waiter said, 'twas not quite right.
For Chipotle Ranch they do add, and eggs to bind,
Making it not vegan, a culinary find.

And at first, 'twas grand, a joy to behold.
But lo, the subsequent classes didst falter,
The instructors late, or cancel without a thought.

The class, designed for young ones, aged one and two,
Didst suffer from poor teaching, I do declare to thee.
The other mothers, cold and unfriendly, didst shun,
Save one, whose child didst play with mine, in fun.

To find the fault, doth begin. Mayhap,
The coffee sat too long, ere it was served,

In comparison, to that noble brew.

When a floor manager, with apologies, didst fuss,
And moved us to a better seat, with grace,
And gifted us with drinks and dessert, in her place.

By virtue of a gift most fair and bright,

Of tables crammed in corners, flies that didst swarm,

With beans and rice, a generous helping, did they bring.

But my dear boy, his chimichanga, did find some grace.

Around the board, a consensus did arise,
That though the victuals were not wondrous, neither were they vile.
Of six dishes, chicken fajitas, the best did prove,
Yet, alack, the margaritas, watered down, did not remove

Save straight shots, perchance, then a good time might be got.

Through tables, back and forth, to reach our home,

Thinking it hard to make a mistake,
But lo, the meat was tough and dry,
A disappointment, nigh a lie.

Yet came without a bun, a burning fire,
So we paid more, for him to partake,
And thus, my burger, left untouched, did make.

Deep-fried Oreo sundae, a wondrous sight,
Creative and rich, a decadent treat,
We shared it, but could not finish neat.

""Alas, my visit to this place didst not bode well,
For all around me, others didst revel.
Perhaps I chose a day most foul and ill,
But still, my grievances shall be told.

The vegetables, oh how they didst disappoint,
I had to search through them with great intent.
Carrots and tomatoes, both didst lack sheen,
And sweet and sour sauce, didst taste most lean.

But service, that didst make up for some ill,
Our server, friendly and diligent still.
She didst check on us with regular pace,
And with a smile, didst brighten up the space.

So mayhap, fortune shall smile upon me,
Next time I dine, it shall be a bounty.
Till then, alack, this visit doth beset,
A memory, not so fond, doth linger yet.""",Shakespeare,1

My love, he did enjoy, with pizza, he did chew.

Thick on the bottom, thin on the sides, a crime.
Like pie, it should be, but alas, 'twas not,
A disappointment, akin to frozen thought.

We had tickets for a certain row,

And duplicates were printed, tales unveiled.
We searched for an usher, our guide,
To find our seats, our place to reside.

At last, a kindly usher appeared,
And led us to a distant seat, so queer.
Betwixt families, we sat and watched,
As the show began, its tale unclocked.

With pandas dancing, acrobatics to scatter.
No story, it seemed, just random play,

""Hark! A tale of woe doth come from Crandall's,
Where I, a hungry soul, didst order meals.
Via Grubhub, I didst choose their fare,
But alas! Their service doth leave much to bear.

The first time, I didst enter the wrong address,
And called the restaurant to make amends.
But they, in rudeness, didst deny my plea,
And told me I had the wrong place, indeed.

The second time, I waited for an hour,
But they, in foolishness, didst run out of power.
They called to say they had none left,
And left me with naught but sorrow and bereft.

The third time, they packaged my order awry,
And gave me food that didst not match my cry.
When I didst call to ask for the right fare,
They blamed the delivery man, without a care.

I've never had such poor service, indeed,
And feel compelled to write this Yelp review with speed.
For Crandall's doth lack the skill and grace,
To run a restaurant with proper pace.""",Shakespeare,1

In yonder downtown, where restaurants doth abound.

Friends to seek our counsel, in search of gastronomic delight.

At Cento, alas, our expectations were not met,
For service, poor and lacking, did our patience beset.
No silverware, no napkins, empty glasses lay,
And drinks, unfilled, did prompt our dismay.

The bartenders, though pleasant, didst seem bereft
Of teamwork and customer care, to our grief.
Food, good but not great, didst fail to impress,
As service, shoddy, did our experience repress.

A kindly word with the manager, we didst impart,
Who listened with grace and promised a new start.
But lo, a call, he didst not make, to our dismay,
And thus, our trust, didst fade away.

And hours would pass ere others didst become available,

Save for the shaved face of him whose party it didst behold.

It was past midnight in Vegas and my stomach was growling. My friend said there weren't any good restaurants open, but we found Wolfgang Puck's place in the MGM. It looked fancy, with big rings out front, but the staff was friendly and busy. I got the mushroom and leek pizza, which hit the spot, but the raw leeks were a bit much. The server took her time bringing me my drink, but the Makers Mark and peach drink was worth it. The menu was pricey and the service was slow, so I wouldn't go back.",Hemingway,0

""Hark! What woe is this? My heart doth sink,
For Old Chicago's pizza, once so fine,
Hath now become a shadow of its former self.
Their new Tavern style, a pale imitation,
Doth lack the flavor of their NY-style,
Which they no longer deign to serve.

A pox upon the waitstaff, ignorant and bold,
Who lie to customers with reckless abandon.
I asked if Specialty pizzas were included,
In the half-off deal, a question most innocent.
But lo, the answer given was false,
And our bill, inflated, did cause much vexation.

Farewell, Old Chicago, thy name doth ring,
With disappointment and poor service, a sorry tale.
I shall not return, for pizza so bland,
And mistakes on the bill, do leave a sour taste.""",Shakespeare,1

You've had one sake too many, can't be arsed with a 90-minute bus ride home? Stumble into the nearest hotel, that's what. In our case, it was the Thistle King James Hotel. Twin rooms were all they had left, so we took 'em.

Passed out on what I'd call glorious mattresses, perfect for me, but the boy wasn't a fan. It was bloody hot, and we couldn't find the thermostat. Not a huge deal for me, but the fact that I felt like I was sleeping next to the pissed bloke outside instead of being separated by concrete and six floors got under my skin a bit.

I've lived downtown before, screaming police cars don't phase me. But soundproofing? That's a different story. This building's age shows in its lack of it.

""In Tempe's fair city, where I didst grow,
A liquor store didst stand, most wondrous show.
With flashing lights, a sight to see,
And drive-through, for ease and glee.

As youth, I thought it grand, a place to be,
But when of age, I found it not to see.
Thirty stores lay 'twixt home and thee,
So ne'er didst I venture, wild and free.

Groupon, with deal so fine and fair,
Didst tempt me in, with liquor to spare.
I went, and found it not so grand,
A disappointment, in this liquor land.

Prime rib comes with weak horseradish, cut with butter. Never heard of that before. Luckily, I had sour cream with my baked potato and asked for raw horseradish. It wasn't great, but better than the butter.

""Methought I ordered chicken lo mein, a lunch most fine,
But what they brought me was a pork dish, oh so divine!
The wait, it did take quite a while, I must confess,
But when 'twas served, alack, 'twas not what I did quest.

The pork, it was chewy, and the chicken, too,
No seasoning couldst I taste, naught but blandness anew.
The lo mein, it was passable, but with an oily trace,
And egg drop soup, devoid of flavor, left me in a daze.

An egg roll, strange and mysterious, its contents unkempt,
I broke it apart, but still, its taste was hard to detect.
Red sweet and sour sauce, with heat that did surprise,
But not so bad, methought, a pleasant compromise.

Twice before, I had dined here, and found the fare
To be but mediocre, alas! And now, I do declare,
This third time, it seems, their cooking skills have fled,
For I shall not return, though 'tis near to my bed.

Alas, I would support local businesses, 'tis true,
But this place, I fear, doth not meet my expectations anew.""",Shakespeare,1

The wall of Cascade 220 is gone, the yarn in the coffeeshop room is gone, and what little yarn remains is scattered thinly throughout the shop.

Where dinner was naught but a sorry affair.
A burger from Wendy's didst I consume,
For the meal was so vile, 'twas hard to endure.

The service, though pleasant, was slow as molasses,
With no sense of urgency, nor any haste.
Our party of four didst wait for main courses,
But after 35 minutes, still we had not been asked.

The appetizers, just passable, not too bad,
But salads, o'er-dressed, with watery sauce, they had.
Entrees, a disappointment, save for my companions',
My farfalle pasta, flavorless, a true frustration.
No seasoning, no salt or pepper, a bland disgrace,
Even my fellow diners, in agreement, didst taste.

Alas, the slow service didst mar any delight,
In the meals my friends didst enjoy, but not quite right.

""MGM Grand Buffet? More like 'Meh' Grand Buffet. Serviceable, sure, but not worth the trip. Better options in Vegas, especially when it comes to buffets. They got the usual suspects: crab legs, prime rib, turkey, ribs, shrimp, pasta, pizza, sushi. But let's be real, none of it's all that great. Crab legs ain't even close to Bellagio or Wynn's level. You gotta work too hard to get the meat outta the shells. Rest of the grub? Just okay. Not worth the price tag. If you're gonna charge me $30 ($40 on weekends), give me something special. All-day buffet's nice and all, but quality over quantity, you feel me? Step it up, MGM.""",Hemingway,0

""A Marriott most dreary, that my fate did choose,
By conference's decree, my stay did here dispose.
Inferior, indeed, to that of uptown's kin,
I did rejoice when my departure did begin.

My chamber, high on floor eighteen, did hold
A dampness that did seep, a funk that did unfold.
Yet, in fairness, a kind gesture did they bear,
Turndown service sweet, with candy bars to share.

And food sufficient, future meetings to ensure.

All the victuals didst taste of yore and re-frying, and the fried rice was mushy, like a soggy mess. \n\nThe service, alack! was woeful, and nary a soul didst come to check upon us or refresh our draughts.

Alas, my friends, I must report a woeful tale,
Of wings that failed to impress, nay, did pale.
I sought a happy hour, with brew and snacks,
But found instead a culinary lack.

The service, fair, yet slow, as if in haste,
Did little to improve the sorry taste.
I ordered wings, but oh, how they fell,
Dry, bland, and lacking in flavorful zest.

And though I asked for grilled, they came not,
But drenched in sauce, which made them naught.
My friend, too, shared this disappointment,
A different sauce, but still no improvement.

The beer selection, paltry, I must say,
No rare or special brews to sway.
The atmosphere, good, yet not enough,
To make up for the food's lack of stuff.

So, will I return? Not likely, friends,
For other options call, and time does end.
This place, alas, did not win my heart,
And so, I bid it adieu, a part.",Shakespeare,1

""Beware, good sirs and madams, of this wily tavern! 'Tis a den of trickery, where the serving folk do add a 15% tip, without a word, to thy bill. And lo, the night-owls, deep in their cups, do oft forget to note this subtle swindle, and so they pay twice, in error, for the service they receive.

I, myself, didst fall prey to this ruse, and paid a double tip, ere I didst discover the deceit. Forsooth, the victuals were but mediocre, and the atmosphere, unclean. Two flies didst flit about the hall, a sight most vexing. In truth, Burger King, that humble fast-food chain, doth boast a greater cleanliness than this supposed eatery.

Dry and flavorless, they didst not make my day,
The tortilla, it didst crumble in mine hand,
And the chicken, it didst fall apart, so bland.

The happy hour special, it didst make up the cost,
Buy one drink, get the second free, a bargain indeed,

After a concert at Stage AE, my boyfriend and I were looking for a spot to relax our weary feet. We strolled across the street to The Pittsburgh Grille. The joint had a swell decor, with some snazzy sports murals adorning the walls. They had a bunch of flat-screen TVs scattered around the bar and dining area, but it didn't feel too overwhelming since it was right next to the stadium. I was impressed by the cigar bar - it added a touch of class to the place. The atmosphere was plush and comfy.

We only stayed for one drink, though I would've liked to have a few more. Some gal in the bar was hollering obscenities at a hockey game that wasn't even on. She was the only one causing a ruckus, while everyone else was trying to have a good time. The bartender was too busy flirting to notice our empty glasses, even though there were only a handful of folks in the room.

""Hoped to find a solid BBQ joint. Heard good things, but waited 'til the hype died down. Turns out, it's a bust. Shared a brisket and turkey sandwich with mom, plus some sides.

The check-in, a lengthy affair,
Didst take 45 minutes, with naught but a few pairs.

With restroom fittings, for those in need.

Trash and unfinished drinks, didst greet,
Upon entry, a sorry sight, so neat.
And in the restroom, half-washed cups,
Didst show that haste, didst leave them in a state of flux.

Next morn, we didst request,
Housekeeping, with a quickness, we didst expect.

Perhaps, 'twas the churchgoers, who did wrong

A green salad, dressed in ginger sauce so bright,

The microwave's power, to heat it up, so bold,

And said the grilled chicken, would take some time,
Due to the weather, perhaps, or so he'd assume,
But steaming hot, the Ma-la shrimp and chicken did consume.

But alas, 'twas not meant to be, forsooth,
For all our plans were foiled, and our night did lose its sheen.

The meat, we thought, the fun part of the feast,
To cook it ourselves, and thus, our hunger appease.
But nay, the server said, 'twould taste better,
If they, in the kitchen, did it, and not we, the plodder.

The Grandmother's Special, next, we did ordain,
But lo, they brought the wrong dish, and our hopes did wane.
They grilled the wrong meat, and we did wait,
Until they realized their mistake, and did abate.

And when, at last, the right food did arrive,
Our joy was short-lived, for our cooking, they did deprive.
With tongs, they took, and cooked the meat themselves,
Leaving us, in disappointment, and with no selves.

And to cap it all, a stench did fill the air,
From the kitchen, a sewer-drain overflow, so foul and fair.
We swiftly did depart, with haste, and no delight,
For such a scent, did mar our appetite, and put us to flight.""",Shakespeare,1

""A pox upon this salon, say I! For though my locks didst look fair and bright,
Their prices, they didst play a wicked trick.
I checked their site, and called, to make sure,
That for my wedding updo, I wouldst not be poor.
But when I came, with hair most dry,
My stylist didst insist, it must be blown dry.
And though I asked him thrice, to cease and desist,
He still didst charge me, for the blow dry, he didst persist.
And curling too, they didst charge, without a care,
An extra fee, that we didst not prepare.
Oh, how they took advantage, of our special day,
And left us poorer, in a most unkind way.
So here's a warning, to all who doth seek,
A salon, in a hotel, most unique.
Be wary of their prices, and what they do say,
For they may charge thee, in a most unkind way.""",Shakespeare,1

My joints did ache, the humid air did seize,
We sought refuge from the wet embrace,
And found ourselves within this cozy space.

Their tea, it was a pleasant surprise,
But I, a request, did politely devise,
To brew my own, from my pot, so wise,
They would not allow, a strange surmise.

My server, a woman of ample girth,
Didst greet me with a beaming mirth,
Her smile, it lit the room, like sun on earth,
Despite her size, her spirit had great worth.

My hunger, it did grow with each passing minute,
But alas, my purse, it could not accommodate,
A muffin, small, yet satisfying, did suffice,
As I sipped tea, and waited for the rain to cease.

Until the storm, it did finally subside,
And though my visit, was not without a flaw,
'Twas still a respite, from the rain-soaked tide.""",Shakespeare,1

For though I asked for medium rare, 'twas overcooked, I fear.
My friend, he sent his back, but I, in my folly,
Did not, for I had hoped they'd make it right, you see.

My second beer, it was not as the first,
In taste or appearance, it was quite diverse.

""Verily, this place doth please mine eyes,
I do beseech thee, give it a try.
Upon entrance, gaze downward, friend,
For thou dost stand upon a fishy fiend.
The decor, most trendy, doth impress,
And atmosphere, most chill, doth bless.
A drink we did imbibe at bar,
Upon a Wednesday eve, most fair.
Then forth we went, to patio's embrace,
Where dinner did await, with nary a trace.
Sushi, most delectable, doth delight,
Freshness, in every morsel, doth take flight.
Alas, one quibble, I must confess,
The bathroom sink, a wondrous mess.
Faucets, they do not work, I do declare,
Unless with force, the handle thou dost slam,
And then, the water doth spray, most queer,
In errant bursts, a sight most strange, I fear.
Yet, all else, most excellent, doth be,
This place, a gem, doth shine, for thee to see.""",Shakespeare,3

""Furr's Restaurant, a blast from the past. Grand and Sun City, just off the 101 Highway. Been around since the 50s, but still looking sharp. Had a swell time with some Yelp buddies - Rand, Mike, and Scott. Cafeteria-style, but you can go back for more, all for the same price. No digging through leftovers, just straight up service. Classic American grub, try a bit of everything. Tasty and fresh, can't wait to go back.""",Hemingway,2

""Friday night, my wife and I hit up this joint. Nice weather, so we sat outside. Place was packed, but we didn't mind. They got an English menu, thank God, 'cause my French is rusty. \n\nThey got a ton of pizza options, too many if you ask me. Took us a bit to decide. But we did, and that pizza was damn good. Crust was spot on. So many toppings, we needed utensils. Service could've been better, though. Had to flag the waiter down multiple times for more water. Still, I'd go back.""",Hemingway,2

A true delight, that doth please the senses sweet.""",Shakespeare,3

Aye, verily, a joy 'tis to partake of victuals herein.

Methinks, dear friends, thou shouldst try the Molten Chocolate Cake,
A sweet indulgence that doth live up to its name, by the lake!

For 'tis prepared with care, and taketh some twenty minutes to arrive, ere ye can savor its rich, chocolatey delight.""",Shakespeare,3

A haven in this hotel, clean and fair.
The chamber, spacious, modern, and divine,
Did boast a bed most comfortable, with pillows rare.

The shower, too, did please mine eyes,
With shelf and lighting, pressure that doth rise.
A mirror, lit and swiveling, did allow
Me, shaving in the shower, a gentle repose.

The halls were quiet, ventilation fine,
A testament to comfort, all divine.
The staff, though pleasant, cooperative,
Did falter somewhat, with room service unpredictive.

Not on the Strip, a blessing, most elate.""",Shakespeare,3

Alas, poor wight, the one amongst us who didst order a drink of higher price didst pay dearly for his folly. The ambiance was most tranquil, with seats aplenty and music that didst stir our spirits.

Why, one need not journey far for a piping hot dog or a privy, I do declare! \n\nAnd let us not forget the Suns, good sir.

The tour, a joy, a delight,
With guides, so kind and bright.
Cash only, the price we paid,
Worth it, I didst not hesitate.
But the creator, a man of ill repute,
Didst abandon his daughter, so cruel.
A castle, for his kin, he didst build,
But his actions, didst leave a stain.
His wife and child, he left behind,
And though he gave them wealth, unkind.
Mary Lou, a woman of intrigue,

Their bill of fare doth boast an Italian bent,  
With prime rib, pork, seafood, and Caesar's mint.  
Yet, I, a fool, do stick to pasta's embrace,  
For fear of change, and habit's steady pace.  
But linguiu with king crab, and leeks so fine,  
In lemon butter sauce, doth make my heart entwine.  
My spouse, a traditionalist, doth swear by spaghetti,  
And Kobe meatballs, that doth make his eyes light up so brightly.

Cantonese style, all dishes didst shine anew.
Complimentary soup and dessert, a sweet delight,
Our hunger sated, with nary a single bite.

The crowd, it swelled, as evening drew near,
We waited patiently, without a speck of fear.
Yet, verily, the wait, it was worth the while,
For flavors such as these, doth make us smile.

In the cardiac unit, his cheer and grace,
Did ease my fears and lighten up the space.

Four stars, I gave, despite the wear,
For things that can be fixed, should be made clear,
The creaky hinges and the shaking faucet,
Cried out for mending, with a quick dispatch.

With haste, she took our order, and with speed, our drinks she didst proceed.  
Her care, it was most excellent, for she didst not pester us,  
Nor didst she neglect her duties, but watched o'er us with gentle fuss.  
A man, in plain attire, didst approach, and enquired of our state,  
We answered, all was well, and he, in stealth, didst take my cup,  
And asked, if my waitress had fetched me another ale,

A manager, perchance, he was, yet a name, or badge, he didst lack,

But fear not, dear companions, for I hadst
A Fast Pass, thanks to some kind connections,
Which allowed us swift passage, past the throng
And into the heart of the revelry strong.

For once within, the devil in me didst stir,
And bade me cast aside my cares and fears,
To join the throngs in their wild abandon,
Dancing with joy, and banishing all tears.

The music, which doth oft my senses vex,
Didst seem, in this place, to be a perfect fit,
And I, who ne'er didst care for house and its ilk,
Didst find myself moved by its rhythmic beat and lilt.

The space, so vast and grand, didst hold within
A multitude of merrymakers, lost in sin,
Their laughter and shouts didst ring out through the night,
As we danced on, till the morning light didst break.

With feet sore, but hearts full of mirth and zest,

Do serve the fare, and make my heart feel light.

And lo, the flavors didst not fade away.
E'en when I reached mine home, the taste didst linger,
A testament to their most excellent cooking.

Prepared well, and portions, not bad.
Sides, separate, but large, we found,
The wild mushrooms, eleven, and too profound.

Dessert, we saw, and couldn't resist,

""O, how the reviews didst speak the truth,
Of slow service, a woeful plight.
But when the steak and eggs didst arrive,

For twenty minutes or more, anon.
But still, the taste didst make amends,
For all the time that didst expire.""",Shakespeare,3

The Greentree Inn didst spring to mind, a place divine.
In all my years, so near yet never had I been,
I thanked the stars that led me thither, 'twas a wondrous scene.

A feast fit for a king, or so it seemed to me.
And as I sat, entranced by atmosphere so rare,
I knew that this, my choice, was truly meant to be.""",Shakespeare,3

""Verily, 'tis a pleasure to behold a chain that doth strive for excellence in all they do. In fair California, there doth lie a Habit restaurant, which we didst visit on a whim, and found to be most satisfying. My wife and I, we didst order the same dish, to test the consistency, and lo, it was consistent indeed, and most delectable, I must confess. If thou find thyself in Chandler, with a craving for a savory burger, do not hesitate to partake in the Habit's offerings. Four stars, I wouldst give, for the fare, though somewhat costly, yet worth every penny, forsooth.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark, what greasy delight doth mine eyes perceive? A pizza so divine, it doth leave me in awe. The crust, it doth crackle beneath mine teeth, and the sauce, it doth dance upon mine taste buds with a merry zest. The pepperonis, they doth blanket the piece, a veritable feast for mine hunger. And the cheese, it doth melt within mine mouth, a river of richness that doth never cease. Methinks 'tis a treasure, this New York Pizza of which I speak. A gem hidden amongst the throngs of chain eateries, a place where one may find solace in the form of a savory slice.

But alas, the interior, it doth lack a certain je ne sais quoi. A few tables and chairs, booths and televisions, nothing more, nothing less. Yet, who needs grandeur when the food doth shine so bright? Forsooth, I shall return anon, to partake in their delectable wings, fries, and subs. Aye, for this humble abode doth hold a special place within mine heart, a haven of gastronomic joy.""",Shakespeare,3

With flavors rich, and savory bite.
So come, my friends, and taste for thyself,
For this place truly doth rock, and doth excel.""",Shakespeare,3

Amidst the city's glitz and glam, where kindness doth abound,
In this fair restaurant, all are pleasant and bright,
E'en the staff, with smiles so warm and welcoming, doth ignite.

One star, a quick assembly line, yet friendly faces doth greet,
A fine beginning, indeed, for a meal most meet,
Two stars, the owner doth introduce himself, and doth ensure,
Our pleasure, with meats to sample, and a word of cheer.

Three stars, the Kalua pig, a flavor so divine,
Doth burst forth in thy mouth, a culinary shrine,
No fast food staple, this, but a feast fit for a king,
A true delight, and worthy of thy praise, I do sing.

Four stars, the coconut bark, a treat beyond compare,
A sweet indulgence, worth each penny, beyond compare,
A shame to share, so get thine own, a wise decision,
For this delicious treat, doth merit thy attention.

Alas, the fifth star, doth lack, for tacos and burritos,
Did fall apart, a mishap, in wrapping and filling, no doubt,
Yet still, a place of wonder, for Hawaiian fare,
With chipotle spice, and flavors beyond compare.

The coconut bark, a memory, doth linger near,
A craving, a desire, doth persist, year after year.""",Shakespeare,3

""A swift journey down didst I make from Mesa's heights,
Despite the rabble that didst board the train with me.
Forsooth, 'twas public transport, and I didst bear it well,
Though my legs didst ache from the hard seats, I must confess.
A woeful burden, indeed, for one with Restless Legs Syndrome,
That plagued me still, days after, with pain most grievous.
Yet, for the sake of thrift, I wouldst take the train anon,
Didst save the gas, and hadst naught to do but praise the route.
Alack, my first time, and a costly mistake didst I make,
For my poor car didst get towed, and a $200 fine didst partake.
So, heed my words, good sirs, and mind thee well where thou dost park,
Lest thou suffer the same fate as didst I, in sorrow and in dark.""",Shakespeare,3

And views so grand, it doth our spirits pride.

Option there was, to add a photog too,
And capture all the moments, new and true.
We chose to do so, and glad we art,
For memories kept, in photos smart.

But video, alas, we did not choose,
For one man's task, it doth not excuse.
The mic, it failed, and my voice did fade,
But still, our vows, in love's embrace we made.

To wed in Vegas, in a chopper sleek.

In Charlotte, there lies a place, called Fig Tree, a sight most fair and bright.
I chanced upon this eatery, with my love, on a winter's eve,
Their decorations, festive, did our spirits lift and leave.

My heart, it did desire, their grouper, in butter sauce,
With lobster meat, a-top, a feast, most wondrous and grand, I did avow.
And though the cheese plate, good, did seem a bit steep,
At seventeen coins, a price, that did our purses weep.

My love, she chose, a pork chop, alas, a shame,
For it was fatty, and not, to her taste, a worthy name.
But still, I tried, a bite or two, and though not lean,
I savored each morsel, with relish, like a true gourmand, I mean.

The service, kind and prompt, our server, a delight,
Did make our visit, pleasant, and filled with warmth and light.
So though our meal, not perfect, was our night,
For Fig Tree, a spot, most charming, shall we revisit, anon, with delight.""",Shakespeare,3

The victuals, fresh and delectable, didst delight,
Chow Mein, the best, in many a night.

In Downtown Vegas, our hearts did moan.

A suite in Rush Tower, nicer than before,
In Palazzo, luxury we did ignore.
Despite the heat, and lost riches too,
Our spirits high, our joy did break through.

The staff, attentive and kind, did strive,
To make our stay, a pleasant jive.
Clientele, not flashy, nor trashy,
A perfect blend, of class and brashy.

Table limits, food and drink, all fair,
Our poolside fun, without compare.
My wife, a spa day, did quickly book,
A good value, her relaxation took.

With friends, she's keen, to return once more,

Ziplining, concerts, a joyous parade.

Their chance to pain me. Volunteers, so kind and true,
Didst make my journey through the halls anew.

It took some time, indeed, to gain entry,
But now, I must admit, their care doth shine so brightly.
This VA, it doth serve a multitude,
And patient needs, they do take heed, most rightly.

So here's a thank you, to the staff, so fine,
For tending to my health, with such design.""",Shakespeare,3
1,"
""Hark, good sir or madam, let us begin anon,
The service at the register, most friendly was shown.
Aye, 'twas a sight to behold, a true delight,
The staff, with smiles so bright, did make our day take flight.

And lo, the theaters, they were but passable,
With Turbo, a film most wondrous and able.
But alack, the bathrooms, a sight most foul,
Did leave much to be desired, I do avow.

Yet still, the service, with thanks so genuine,
Did earn four stars, a rating most divine.""",Shakespeare,3
1,"
""Hark, my dear son! I have a word for thee,
A dish most wondrous, fit for royalty.
'Tis porkbellies, grilled to perfection,
With sides of rice, eggplant, macaroni, and cucumber,
A feast most satisfying, crunchy, and sweet.
Indeed, it doth not get much better than this,
A meal most excellent, fit for a king or queen.""",Shakespeare,3
1,"
""Methinks 'tis a place most wondrous fair,
With melodies that do delight mine ear,
And potions strong, that do stir mine spirits high,
Upon that roof, where one may gaze upon the sky.

Yet, alack, 'tis true, the crowd doth swell,
And four stars, not five, my rating doth tell.
For entry, naught didst we pay, nor didst we wait,
And through an escalator, Playboy Club, we didst straight pass.

A marvel, indeed, that such a place doth be,
Connected thus, in elegance and luxury.""",Shakespeare,3
1,"
""Fair sir, the victuals here be good, the attendance most kind,
Yet doth the bill of fare seem somewhat scant, and lacking in design.
In sooth, the viands be clean, wholesome, and true,
But wherefore doth the crowd not gather, as I do reckon they should?
Alas, 'twas but a weekday, and nigh upon the hour of one,
And lo, the tavern lay empty, devoid of mirth and fun.
Pray tell, what causeth this dearth of patrons, pray?""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark, my dear friend! While I may not be the greatest aficionado of Mexican cuisine in our fair village, I must confess that dining here hath always been a pleasure.

Verily, their Veggie Burro doth reign supreme, a culinary delight indeed!""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! What luck didst thou bring us, fair Pub and Grill?
A night before, at Gordon Ramsey's, we did dine,
But this, my friends, didst far surpass the bill.
We arrived at eleven, to avoid the throng,
And found the place bustling, with folk galore,
Ten parties waited, their patience to test,
But we, dear friends, didst not have to endure the woe.

Our server, kind and fair, didst guide us through,
The menu vast, with choices manifold,
She shared her wisdom, her suggestions made,
And we, dear friends, didst take her counsel to our heart.

The burgers, oh! How juicy and divine!
No fault couldst we find, in taste or form so fine.
Sweet potato fries, a mountain high and steep,
We struggled to finish, but 'twas a happy sleep.

The price, so fair and reasonable, a delight,
For thirteen to fifteen coins, a feast most bright.
Alas, the shakes, we didst not get to try,
But shall, anon, forsooth, ere we say goodbye.

A great place, indeed, with service true,
We shall return, and that, anon, we'll do.""",Shakespeare,3

'Tis Danny's Family, with locations many,
Their business thrives, as the crowds demonstrate.

Oh, how I love to wait, until the need is great,
To feel the joy of a clean car, oh so elate!

Danny's does the deed, with speed and care,
A job well done, beyond compare.

And lo, on Tuesdays, a discount doth await,
For ladies, a perk, a benefit so great!

Then note it well, and heed my words,
On Tuesdays, to Danny's, thy car convey!""",Shakespeare,3

""In sooth, this creperie doth lie within a strip mall, and dimly lit it be. Yet, cozy and casual it doth feel, and comforting doth the food prove to be. For groups of four or more, al fresco dining shall be thy fate, at the front of the establishment thou shalt sit. A small counter doth provide a space to watch the crepes being made, as thou dost enjoy thy repast. A Frisco crepe, with fresh blueberries in lemon curd, powdered sugar, and whipped cream, didst I order. Perfect with my morning coffee, it was, yet a tad more lemon curd, I didst desire. For those who wish to venture forth from their usual breakfast fare, 'tis a place most excellent. FUNtastic, indeed!""",Shakespeare,3

""Freshest ingredients, Italian dishes most true, Decor authentic, as if from Tuscany anew. Fast delivery, a marvel, I must confess.

Mattarocca, oh how sweet thy flavor doth lie.""",Shakespeare,3

With location on the Royal Mile so rare.
A climb, indeed, from train station steep,
Yet worth it, for the view of Arthur's Seat doth keep.

Older architecture, crypt-like bar doth hold,
Nespresso machine in room, a Radisson gold.
Bed, enormous, super comfy, a delight,
But alas, poor TV reception, a sorry sight.

Reception service, excellent in every way,
Helped with restaurant choice, for quiet day.
Reserved a table, with book in hand,
A peaceful meal, without a single stand.""",Shakespeare,3

""Methinks 'twas much improved, this second stay,
Compared to when we first did come this way,
When Aladdin's magic didst fade away,
And Planet Hollywood took its place, by day.

I am glad, fair friends, that I didst give
This hotel chain another chance to live,
For now we have a room most fair and bright,
With two queens, non-smoking, and a plasma in sight.

A bottle of Skyy Vodka, free of charge,
Didst come with our room, a gift so large,
And forty dollars in casino play,
To boot, my dears, what more could one say?

The bathroom, spacious and clean, didst boast
A tub, a shower, and two sinks at the cost,
Of but a single room, a steal, methinks,
For us four ladies, and our many blinks.

But, alas, dear friends, there was a flaw,
In the form of lighting, dim and raw,
The room, though large, didst lack in lights,
And left us groping in the darkest nights.

And, verily, the bathroom didst grow hot,
From too much light, a fault, I do not,
But, all in all, we didst enjoy our stay,
Despite a bed with stains, which didst fade away.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! A culinary delight doth lie within this eatery's walls, my friends! Forsooth, I didst partake of their savory beef arepa, a dish most wondrous and divine. Yet, alas! The chicken salad, a dish of mediocrity, didst not impress mine taste buds as much. But lo! Their grilled chicken, served with rice and beans, didst make mine mouth to water and mine belly to sing with joy! 'Tis a feast fit for a king, I say! And, by the stars, I shall return anon to sample their delectable empanadas, for they didst appear most appetizing, indeed!""",Shakespeare,3

The fair but uncomfortable chairs, once a sight to behold, Have been replaced with cushioned seats, though somewhat too wide for the tables, alack! \n\nWe began our feast with Summer Rolls, large and delectable, beyond my expectations, indeed! The beef within had a charcoal flavor, quite delightful, and fresh veggies wrapped in rice paper, a refreshing treat, served with a light fish sauce, a perfect complement. \n\nMy Spicy Stir-Fry, not as fiery as I had hoped, yet still possessed a pleasant kick, I must confess. The chicken, cooked to perfection, a medley of fresh crunchy veggies, all cloaked in a well-balanced sauce, a veritable feast for the senses! 'Twas a dish most excellent, and worth every penny of its meager price, $7.25, a true bargain, by my reckoning. \n\nVerily, I say unto thee, my dear friend, that thus far, naught but satisfaction hath I known at this establishment.

In fair Las Vegas, where we chanced to roam,
We celebrated our first year of wedlock's home.
At Margaritaville, within Flamingo's walls,
We savored tacos, and sipped flavored margaritas that enthralled.

With live music that did banish all fear.
A place most suitable for families, I do declare,
Margaritaville, a haven of delight, beyond compare.",Shakespeare,3

For adults who seek to indulge and explore.
Rows upon rows of wine, beer, and spirits,

The staff, so friendly and eager to help,
Makes one feel welcome, and the experience quite swell.
I found a beer, Alien Stout, oh so fine,
And Nut Brown Ale, a taste divine.

Wells Banana Bread beer, a surprise,
Beyond belief, a true delight.
The wine selection, vast and grand,
Intimidating, yet, a treasure to behold.

Glassware and snacks, aplenty to choose,
To complement your drink, and make it quite loose.
Boarhead meats and cheeses, a delicious find,
And chips and mixes, for a tasty mind.

In conclusion, this store is a gem,
A place to find all your alcoholic whims.

Our server, a friendly soul, made our evening bright.
We talked of beer and food, and shared our tales,
And the ambiance, it was quite divine, I daresay.
The food, oh how it did impress,
Especially the Brussels sprouts, a tasty mess.

But alas, the second time, 'twas not so grand,
Our server, seemingly stoned, did not take a stand.
He came, he went, he brought our check,
And left us wondering, what the heck?
The food, it was decent, I must confess,
But the service, oh how it did disappoint, I must profess.
So, Root, a place of wonder, indeed,
But hit or miss, it seems, is how they proceed.""",Shakespeare,3

The track, once soggy, now doth lie dry and flat,

Appetizers, aplenty, for all to share,
The atmosphere, light, fun, a joyous air,
Our friends, they danced, and laughter filled the lair.

But, alas, a quibble, small, yet worth the tell,
The staff, at times, did seek my counsel,
As if 'twere mine, the reins, to hold and sway,
I thought, their role, to guide, not me, to play.

Yet, friendly, they were, and our joy, they did enhance,

On Sunday, Solin and I didst venture forth to Spring Valley Park,
A place of recreation, full of merriment and joy.
We searched the internet, and this park didst emerge,
With recommendations grand, and praise didst employ.

Three fenced sections there be, for dogs of all size,
And Solin, being a poodle, didst enter with great guile.
The area was vast, and many dogs didst play,
With frisbees flying high, in a most delightful way.

A water fountain for dogs, and bags to clean,
Didst supply our needs, and Solin didst gleam.
He ran and played, with energy unbound,
Like a child in a candy store, his joy didst resound.

But lo, a strange sight didst catch mine eye,
Two dogs, their noses locked, in a curious guise.
""Don't worry,"" said the owner, with a smile so bright,
""Dogs sniff each other's rear, 'tis their nature's plight.""

I laughed and marveled at this wondrous sight,
And thanked the owner for her words, so wise and bright.
Solin had a grand time, and so didst I,
At Spring Valley Park, where dogs can run and fly.",Shakespeare,3

Aye, the prices didst seem fair, comparable to others,
But still, my purse didst feel the pinch of each brother.
If speed and proximity be my desire,
This place doth fit the bill, like a burning fire.

The atmosphere didst please mine eyes,
With decor fitting for a Mexican surprise.
Good cheer and beer didst flow like a stream,
And service, prompt as any good dream.

Specials they didst offer, a feast for the sight,
Worth trying, no doubt, with all thy might.""",Shakespeare,3

Their breakfast, lunch, and coffee, all divine.
The decor, trendy, yet I do not pay heed,
For 'tis the food and service, that doth feed.

A BLT, I ordered, and with haste, they brought,
With egg, a surprise, yet I didst not fault.
In Canada, a chain called Tim Horton's doth reign,
With BELT, their menu, a similar refrain.

The sandwich, delicious, and the lady fair,
Didst wait upon me, with kindness and care.
She asked my thoughts, and chatted with glee,
Great customer service, a sight to see.

For poor service of a maid, Sabrina, anew.

Six of us sat in a booth, and when she came,
To take our order, I didst explain my aim.
Separate tickets, I requested, for my wife and me,
But she refused, with a shake of her head, ye see.

I asked if we could sit elsewhere, and she said,
""Yep, that's fine,"" but no explanation didst proceed.
I pressed her further, and she grew irate,
With a snarl, she spake, ""It's policy, don't debate.""

I vowed not to return, and her reply didst show,
The very reason why some workers do not glow.
Their attitude, akin to a sore, doth fester,
And makes one wonder, doth their labors matter?""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! AMC Rainbow Promenade, 'tis 1990, and it doth seek its former glory. Verily, this cinema doth show its age, and couldst use a sprucing up, methinks. In days of yore, 'twas a bustling hub of entertainment, but now, with newer theatres boasting luxurious amenities, 'tis easy for this humble abode to be forgotten. When last didst thou behold an AMC 10? Are they not now numbered 20 or 30? Yet, there be charm in the likes of this theatre. Firstly, deals abound, and the staff, they be kind and helpful. Secondly, peacefulness doth reign, untroubled by the throngs that flock to grander cinemas. Ah, but 'tis the company and the tale itself that maketh the experience most enjoyable.

Into a studio room he went, and shortly thereafter did emerge.  
A few moments passed, and then they showed him, pictures and poses of great worth,  
Indeed, they did a fantastic job, no doubt of that on earth!  
Classic gown shot they took, for yearbook purpose,  
But casual clothes, in pose, they captured too, with finest art.  
I had not planned to buy more, but such quality, could not ignore,  
So, friends and kin, I would this studio highly recommend, forevermore!""

""Hark, good sir! If thou dost seek a feast most fair and fine,
Look no further than Sakana, 'tis a place divine.
Their appetizers, like dynamite, doth explode with flavor,
And nigiri, fresh and oversized, doth make thy mouth water.

Alas, the rice, a noble feature, doth reign supreme,
A veritable delight, that doth surpass all else.
But, alack! The uni and oysters, fresh and sweet,
Are now but memories, and our hearts do ache.

Yet still, the fried dishes, specialty rolls, and more,
Doth make this place most worthy of a man's desire.
The Super White and Garlic Tuna, stars of the show,
Doth shine so bright, that all who taste, do glow.

Lobster and Popcorn Lobster Rolls, a delightful treat,
Doth bring a smile to those who partake.
But, alas, the Bulgogi, doth not impress,
Leave it to the side, and choose the Quail Egg, a gem.

Forgive me, gentle reader, for my mistake most grievous,
Ordering more than we could chew, a folly most egregious.
But, kindness doth abound, for they didst not charge,
For the last two rolls, a mercy most large.

So, here's to Sakana, a place most wondrous,
With service courteous, and a pleasure most delectable.
And if they have uni, when next we doth come,
A five-star rating, shall be their due, anon.""",Shakespeare,3

Under new management, with a changed demeanor, somehow.
Before, when 'twas in disarray, I wouldst not give it much praise,
For dirtiness didst reign, and fears of tainted victuals didst raise.

But lo! Now doth it seem, this Burger King doth thrive,
With staff attentive, friendly, and swift, they do strive.
Cleanliness doth reign, and all doth seem in order,
A far cry from before, when chaos didst border.

Mayhap this change shall last, and continue to endure,
For 'tis a welcome sight, this once-troubled place to ensure.""",Shakespeare,3

A place where stars like Andre Agassi doth frequent.
My dear companion, Mrs. C, doth order with grace,
A three-course feast, at a price most modest and fair.

Chicken consomme, brought forth in a teapot of elegance,
Sear'd scallops, with bacon and mushroom cream, a true delight.
Creme brulee, a sweet and satisfying conclusion,
A meal fit for a king, at a price most reasonable.

But lo, on Sundays, the steak doth come at a discount,
Fifty percent off, a truly wondrous amount.
I, myself, didst order the New York Strip,
A fine cut of meat, cooked to perfection, no need to rip.

A baked potato, I didst wish, to accompany my steak,

Which didst seem quite strange, and not at all like a treat.  
The striped bass, it didst delight mine eyes,  
And the flavor of the tortelli didst take me by surprise.  
But alas, the plating, it didst not impress,

A humble sandwich shop, once named Brown Bag, now Arizona's gold.
A quarter mile from our workplace, 'twas a frequent haunt,
But since its transformation, my visits have augment.

Their sandwiches, oh so delectable, a feast for the taste,
Soft bread, like downy pillows, doth embrace the fillings with haste.
Generous portions, aplenty, doth satisfy my hunger's pang,
And sides, a delightful complement, doth make my meal most grand.
Desserts, a sweet allurement, doth tempt mine eyes,
But alack! I rarely partake, forsooth, I do not tell lies.

A warm welcome, by name, doth greet us now,
A daily special, a wise choice, doth never let me down.
Follow them on Facebook, a secret, 'twill reveal,
A two-dollar sandwich, a steal! A bargain, beyond belief, ye may feel.

Eastward, across the street, from QT's corner throne,
Lies this eatery, unassuming, yet a gem, unknown.
A quick escape, in fifteen minutes, or less,
For busy souls, a blessing, in disguise, I do profess.

Join me, dear friends, and partake in this gastronomic treat,
At Arizona Sandwich Company, a culinary delight, so neat.""",Shakespeare,3

With steak, rice, broccoli, and spicy sauce, 'twas a sight to see.
A simple feast, yet full of flavor's delight,
The sauce, on the side, didst bring forth a wondrous bite.

Their sushi, bowls, and salads, numerous and grand,
Priced fairly, for the portions they command.
The restaurant's decor, modern and sleek,
The staff, fast, friendly, and most courteous, didst seek.

Alas, a minor flaw, the steak not quite hot,
Nor sliced through, so when I shook the bowl, 'twas not.
But fear not, dear friends, for I shall return,
To savor more of this tasty gem, and learn.""",Shakespeare,3

A Market Sunflower salad, with blackened fowl, goat cheese, bacon, dried fruit, and sunflower seeds, I didst order. My husband, a Smoked Turkey Ciabatta, with gouda, bacon, tomato, and roasted red pepper aioli, didst choose. My salad, I didst love, but my husband's sandwich, not fully satisfied, he was. Yet, sweet potato chips, most delectable they were! This place, again I wouldst visit.""",Shakespeare,3

In sooth, who could have thought that Las Vegas, famed for its vice,
Would e'er be known for sandwiches of such nice?
I, for one, now believe it, after tasting the Earl's delight,
At Planet Hollywood, where gambling and feasting unite.

I ordered the Full Montagu, a roast beef of renown,
With turkey, Swiss, and cheddar, lettuce, and Earl's crown.
I omitted the tomatoes, lest they o'erwhelm the dish,
For too much juice can make a sandwich lose its charm and wish.

And thus, I savored the Earl's grey lemonade, a refreshing treat,
Not overly sweet, a perfect complement to the feast.
But 'twas the Earl's artisan bread that stole the show,
A sturdy vessel for the meat and toppings, neither too slow.

So if thou find thyself in Las Vegas, and seek a respite,
From buffets and their excess, choose Earl of Sandwich, a true delight.",Shakespeare,3

The price, indeed, doth rise above the rest,
But the experience, methinks, doth make it worth the cost,
With shops and eateries all around, a convenient feast,
And, by the way, armed guards doth roam the grounds,
A curious sight, yet, I suppose, a necessary means.

$20 each, a sum most unfortunate, I pray.

But lo, the second time, our group didst score,
For ladies were free, and gents didst pay $40,
A sum most reasonable, on that Labor Day eve.
The line for guest list, it did move with great speed,
Like a swift river, flowing forth with great ease.

The venue itself, most spacious and grand,
Didst remind me of Marquee and XS, so bland.
A pool outside, a dance floor within,
Bars on opposite sides, a sight most win.

But the true delight, my friends, doth lie,
In the lights, the LED screens, the LED disco ball,
The lasers, oh, the lasers, how they didst shine,
A sight most wondrous, truly divine.
Great DJs also, didst play the tunes,
A night most memorable, with naught but boons.

And mark you well, my friends, Drai's doth sit,
Within the Cromwell hotel, a place most fit.
Free valet parking, a service most kind,
So give the valet a tip, and be most mind.""",Shakespeare,3

Similar to Town Square, it doth abide,
And from the 215 freeway, it doth reside.
I, myself, have watched it grow with glee,
As I do dwell but a short distance away, ye see.

Oh, how I do detest those shops of old,
That doth provide poor service, cold.
Shaggy Chic and Off Broadway Shoe Warehouse,
Their customer service doth leave much to be desired, alas.

The strip, at night, doth shine with all its might.

But, prithee, tell me, didst thou find no cause to fret?
A green light, troublesome, didst thou not forget?
Yet, verily, 'twas naught but small annoy.
For, on the second night, thou didst grow accustomed, so.

And, lo, they offered thee a discount, quite fair.
On MGM's buffet, twenty dollars off, didst thou declare.
The food, though not the best, didst please thy taste.

Where drinks are served in cups, like a witch's potion's guise.
Once entranced by the music and inflamed by desire,
Thou mayst fall under the spell, like one consumed by fire.

Forsooth, 'tis a place of wonder, unique and rare,
A bar transformed into a haven of delight, beyond compare.
A place where love and passion do reign supreme,
Where hearts are won and lost, like a game of chance, it seems.

If thou art interested, fair maiden, and hast the means,
Thou canst purchase a bottle of whisky, and it shall be seen,
Suspended high above the bar, a sight to behold,
A symbol of thy love, forever to be told.

Not drowned in dressing, as oft we find elsewhere.
The veggies, cooked just right, still crunchy,
No overcooking, to our delight didst savor.

A rare filet, I ordered, and behold!
It came, a wonder, rare indeed, but lacking blood.
My spouse, the filet and crab didst choose,
Both cooked to perfection, no need for excuse.

In compact mirrors, pencils, pens, and key lights,
With creatures adorned, so cute and so fine,
Reduced to 99p, a steal, a true find.

But in the wedding section, a strange sight didst meet,
A box with words, ""Congratulations,"" didst greet,
And within, a bobble head cat, with diamonds so bright,
A curious gift, a puzzle, a wonder in sight.

I know not of wedding ways, nor traditions so grand,
But this gift, a surprise, a laughter-maker, at hand,
A treasure to behold, a joy to behold,

To make me presentable once more, ere the day.

I showed up at the salon, sans appoint,
And waited but ten minutes,'mongst the throng,
Jimmy, skilled artisan, did then attend,
And gave my feet a stone pedicure, so grand.

And ombre nails, five more, did I choose,
To make my feet most fair, and win applause.

""We stepped into Salsa's, a place that leaned more towards Americanized Mexican food. Not bad, just different. If authenticity was what you sought, you might want to look elsewhere. \n\nInside, the decor was pleasant. The lighting, however, was a bit of a nuisance. The combination of ceiling fans and low lights created a strobe effect that was almost unbearable. We had to move to avoid it. \n\nThe service was top-notch. Our glasses were always full, and the food arrived promptly. I usually ask for recommendations at new restaurants, and our waiter was happy to oblige. A nice touch. \n\nThe food was delicious. Fresh ingredients and well-balanced sauces. I had a steak chimichanga that ranked among the best I've had. For this style of Mexican food, Salsa's is definitely worth a visit.""",Hemingway,2

""Hark, what news is this? A gathering of thirty scholars, tired from a week of rigorous study, didst seek respite in the hallowed halls of Biblos. And, verily, 'twas a wise choice indeed! For within its stately walls, we found a warm and welcoming atmosphere, despite the throngs of people that didst fill it to the brim. Upstairs, we didst take our place, and with the soft strains of music in the air, we didst feel transported to a realm of elegance and refinement. The prices, though steep, didst not break the bank, and lo, they didst offer discounts to students, a fact that didst bring us joy and wonder. The menu, a vast and wondrous tome, didst present to us a host of delectable options, each one more tantalizing than the last. The staff, kind and patient, didst attend to our every need, even turning down the music that we might hear our professors' words. And the food, oh, the food! Generous portions, expertly prepared, didst leave us in a state of culinary bliss.

With children stricken, different ills displayed.
The staff, kind and courteous, did attend,
And to our needs, they did promptly tend.

When low oxygen levels caused alarm,
They saw us straightaway, no time to disarm.
Diagnosis accurate, our fears allayed,
A doctor's skill, our child's health restored in play.

X-rays too, they took, to check for break,
A toddler's pinky, and its fragile make.
The wait, a bit dull, the crowd diverse,
But worth the drive, to seek their expertise.
Urgent cares passed, we made our way,
For pediatric care, their skills we'd engage.""",Shakespeare,3

Crunchy, chewy, caramel, peanut butter divine,
Chocolate sauce, whipped cream, a feast for eyes,
So vast, 'twas impossible to consume with ease.

Swift service, brief delay, worth waiting for,

Didst join me in this quest, our zeal unsealed.
We found Sky Zone, a place of joy,
Where trampolines doth reign, a space employ.

With moon shoes donned, and waivers signed,
We entered in, our spirits aligned.
A vast expanse of bouncy bliss,
Where dodge ball doth await, a test of skill.

But we, exhausted, didst take a seat,
Our stamina lacking, our strength deplete.
An hour, a lengthy span, didst pass,
And we, in shame, didst exit, alas.

For those who crave a childlike glee,

Potstickers come with two sauces, hot chili oil and regular. Good stuff, can't beat the price at happy hour ($2.50).

But those who seek strong drink, may find release,
In seats that foster love, or mix with strangers' cheer,
A place where grilled cheese and tomato soup doth appear.

""Hark! I've only used Sunset Park for my canine friend,
For 'tis a place where dogs can run and play,
Two parks there be, for big and small,
With hoses and poopie bags, for all to see.

A shaded area, with tables, for owners to rest,
While their furry friends frolic and quest.
But alas, some owners, with entitlement they bear,
And their dogs, they do not teach to share.

My pup, she doth not socialize,
She prefers me, her human, to be near.
But other dogs, they doth not understand,
And leave her be, they doth not command.
Their owners, they do not help, I fear,
For they let their dogs, my pup to molest.

One regular, with words unkind, did say,
""If thou dost not want rough play, go away.""

And wings, oh how they do delight,

Are plentiful, and a healthy pleasure,
And desserts, for the young ones, too,

A haven of tranquility did beckon me.
The fourth star, for atmosphere and grace,
Did shine bright, in this modern palace of delight.

Within its walls, a pretty bar did lie,
Adorned with charm, and spirits did fly.
I savored one of their special brews,
A Hot Mule, its taste did my senses woo.

No hint of a buzz, yet sipping slow,
Did grant me respite from the world's mad flow.
Few others joined me in this peaceful space,
Amidst the week, when crowds did not embrace.

When weekends dawn, and nights are young.
Yet mid-week, mid-day, serenity did reign,

So we could leave and partake in another place nearby.

The bar, it seemed, had room for us to wait,
And thus we ordered drinks, and a tasty treat,
Pesto fries, they were, and oh, how grand,
They whetted my appetite, for the pesto pasta in hand.
I ordered it, and glad I am that I did,
For the creamy sauce, it did my taste buds stir,
My husband, he had fish and chips, a fine dish,
With tartar sauce, that left him in pure bliss.

I couldst not sample all, alack, what a tease!

Olive breads, alas, I couldst not partake of all theoups.
Desserts, oh how sweet, a feast for mine eyes,
Cheesecake, macrons, lemon meringue, chocolate surprise!

Though I've not stayed here, 'tis a spot most fair.
The staff, kind and courteous, doth make us feel welcome,
And the premises, cleanliness doth prevail.

We've supped at many restaurants, and found delight,
In the fare they serve, both day and night.
Zenshin, the new addition, doth shine so bright,
A haven for games, laughter, and delight.

Bingo, bowling, movies, and comedy, too,
A variety of diversions, for old and new.
The crowds, they do not hinder, our merriment,
For here, 'tis easy to find one's content.

So, if thou seeketh a place of joy and cheer,
Come hither, friend, and cast away fear.
For here, within these walls, doth lie a treat,
A haven of delight, for thee to greet.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark, what luck we had at this most wondrous feast,
A buffet on the Strip, where we didst find
A bounty of delights, both savory and sweet,
And all for just $32 per person, 'twas a treat.

We entered without wait, a true miracle indeed,
And found the spread to be quite varied and grand.
The tacos, oh how they didst delight,
With flavors and spices that didst take flight.

A salsa bar, full and fresh, didst complement,
The hot and sour soup, a true revelation.
Crab legs, a treasure, didst arrive at last,
A fitting end to our meal, or so we thought.

But alas, not all was perfect, I do confess,
The Caesar salad, o'er dressed, didst taste of saltiness.
And prime rib, cooked too long, didst become dry,
A shame, for it didst have such promise in the sky.

Desserts, aplenty, didst catch mine eye,
But alas, I was so full, could only try
A scoop of blood orange sorbet, a refreshing delight,
And thus, our meal didst come to an end, with great delight.

The restrooms, nearby, a short walk away,
And service, average, nothing to dismay.
I shall return, for sure, to this place,
For more of its wonders, and its culinary grace.""",Shakespeare,3
1,"
""Hark! A fortnight past, I chanced upon this place,
And since, have visited oft, with joy and grace.
Their Chinese fare, doth please mine taste,
And quick, their service doth make haste.

A small, cozy interior, with booths and tables few,
Yet warmth and welcome, doth there shine through.
The waitresses, with diligence and cheer,
Do tend to guests, with nary a speck of fear.

In a strip-mall, south of Walgreens' domain,
Doth Great Wall stand, with Sherwin Williams' gain.
Little Caesars too, doth join the fray,
A trio of shops, in one place, what say?""",Shakespeare,3
1,"
""O, how my heart did sing with joy and bliss,
When first I laid eyes on thee, sweet dish.
Thy prices, fair and reasonable, didst please,
And with thy taste, my senses didst tease.

Indeed, I knew not what to do,
For thou, a feast for both my belly and my view.
I didst partake of thee, and oh, how grand,
The flavors danced upon my tongue, so bland.

Thus, I didst fall in love with thee,
My dearest dish, my heart's devotion.
For thou, a treasure, beyond compare,
A culinary delight, most rare.""",Shakespeare,3

""With rumbling bellies, we didst venture forth upon the Pennsylvania turnpike, seeking succor in the form of Indian cuisine. Our hunger pangs didst threaten to consume us whole, yet we resisted the temptation of a nearby sandwich shop, opting instead to press onward in search of spicier fare. In a state of near-famished delirium, we stumbled into Coriander India Grill, whereupon we were greeted by a kindly host who showed us to a cozy booth. Moments later, a platter of crispy chips arrived, accompanied by three mysterious dipping sauces - green, brown, and chartreuse. Though ignorant of their composition, we devoured them with relish, our taste buds stirred to life by their tangy flavors. Perusing the menu, we placed our orders: lamb vindaloo, its spice level a fearsome 10, and palak paneer, a comparatively mild 7. Dosas, those delectable southern Indian crepes, beckoned to us from the menu, but we feared to risk their unfamiliar flavors upon our already-taxed stomachs. The meals arrived in due course, and oh, how they delighted our senses! The vindaloo seared our tongues with its fiery heat, while my wife's palak paneer proved a rich, creamy indulgence. Sated and content, we quit the restaurant, our faces aglow with the aftermath of a satisfying repast.""",Shakespeare,3
1,"
""A fine selection of beers. The menu looked good too, we didn't eat, but it seemed promising, and local! We had sangria on the terrace, it was pleasant. My only criticism is that we went in the early afternoon and it lacked atmosphere... A little background music would have done the trick :)""",Hemingway,2

""Methinks 'tis a fair deal, my friends,
For sixteen silver pence, a feast doth lie.
Crab legs, though not of highest rank,
Are joined by prime rib, sushi, and clam broth,
A stir-fry of note, and Chinese fare,
With gelato, premium, to conclude the share.

In Las Vegas, seekers of a bargain true,
This buffet find, and their bellies fill anew.
I've seen many spreads, but this one, I do confess,
Hath won my heart, with price and victuals in excess.

Yet mark my words, arrive by five and thirty,
Lest thou stand in line, and tarry tediously.""",Shakespeare,3

""Methinks 'tis my first visit to this establishment on this day,

""Methinks we sat at yonder bar,
And lo, the bartender didst attend to us with care.
A Lollipop Passion Goblet we didst order,
And verily, 'twas a wondrous draught, beyond compare.
For thirty-six silver pieces, 'twas a worthy fee,
To partake of such a marvel, a true delight for thee.

The ice, it was dry ice, and thus didst create,
A misty veil, that didst add to the drink's allure.
Tasting of Midori Sour, it didst please our palate,
And lollipops and candy necklaces, didst complete the state.

Fries and fried mac n cheese, we didst also request,
The former, middling fair, the latter, a culinary success.
I shall return, to sample more of their goblets and fare,
For this establishment, doth possess a certain flair.""",Shakespeare,3

""With my fair maidens, I didst dine here late,
After a night of mirth and revelry.

And my coffee cup, they didst refill, in play.""",Shakespeare,3

In Princess Mall, I didst wait for bus,
With time to spare, and thoughts of frivolous,
I chanced upon a Spud U Like,
A place of old, where memories doth reside.

The sour cream and chives, I didst choose,
While Sylvia, baked beans didst dispose,
A Slovak, with beans, didst seem quite odd,
But then, I thought, perhaps they do bake,

Meal A, a topped up tater, with a drink,
I ordered, but a coffee, I didst think,
So forty pence, more, I didst pay,
For a brew, that didst brighten up the day.

The spuds, they were delicious, indeed,
The service, swift, and the young man, pleasing,
A fine distraction, 'twas, before the bus,
To airport, didst take me, with nary a fuss.",Shakespeare,3

Before or after, do visit Wine Expression,
To complete a most delightful afternoon's session.""",Shakespeare,3

""My first visit, I must confess,
All my coworkers did speak the best,
Of this place, with much enthusiasm,
But alas, the exterior doth lack luster.

Do not bring a first date here, my friend,
For the ambiance doth leave much to amend,
Dark and dim, like a cave, it doth seem,
And the staff, they doth resemble skaters, extreme.

But fear not, for their service doth shine,
Friendly, polite, and most attentive, they be,
Their beer selection, a paragon of fine,
A tab of excellence, for all to see.

The expanded section, for groups, doth fit,
Our work happy hour, it did fulfill,
And the menu, oh how it doth delight,
Carne Asada, a concoction, most excellent, a sight.

Calzones, a clever twist, a masterful spin,
Creativity, at its finest, doth win,
Ambiance, three stars, too dark, I say,
But staff, five plus, their service, doth sway.

Food, five plus, the calzone, a dream,
Take home, a pleasure, no need to scream,
Beer, five stars, a selection, most grand,
A tab, of which, few places can boast, in this land.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark, what service we didst receive!
The decor, a sight to behold, doth please.
And food, oh how it doth delight,
A feast fit for a king, I do declare.

My first time, since last I didst dine,
For lunch, a meal most fine and fair.
All these, they didst impress,
Pre-game bread, a taste so rare.
Bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin, a treat,
Lobster, my wife's, a delicacy so sweet.
Sweet corn and polenta, a perfect pair,
Bacon and Yukon gold, a gratin so fair and rare.
Forbidden rice, a name so bold,
A dish that doth intrigue and unfold.
Wine list, with waiter so wise,
A treasure trove of flavors, a surprise.
Mashed potatoes, a humble delight,
A culinary journey, through the night.

Give it a try, this place so rare,
A hidden gem, beyond compare.
Elements at the Sanctuary, a taste so true,
A secret spot, for me and you.""",Shakespeare,3

""A most excellent eatery, in truth,
With victuals, service, and ambiance of youth.
French cuisine, I had tried ere now,
And found it wanting in quantity, I vow.
But here, oh here, the portions be fair,
Steak and seafood, both in abundance share.
And tasty, by my troth, beyond compare,
The fries and bread, a culinary pair.
Seat thee outside, if weather doth allow,
For romance doth reign, and the strip doth show.
Four and a half stars, I would bestow.""",Shakespeare,3
1,"
""A most excellent spot, where one may linger and enjoy. The hospitality, warm and welcoming, doth make one feel at home.

In quantity they flow, a river vast,
Yet cheap, my friends, a price most modest.

But heed this warning, lest ye be deceived,
For dresses, no returns shall be reprieved.
Exchange or store credit, that is all,
So try on well, ere ye make thy call.

A place for youth, where fashion reigns,
From teens to thirty, all may gain.
Trendy garb, and some not so fair,
But each to their own, without compare.

Organized, the racks they keep with care,
And often restock, to show they dare.
The service, middling, yet the maidens kind,
If asked, assist thee, with hearts inclined.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! This eating house, once Yoshi's or Kyoto Bowl, doth now entice thee with its changed ambiance. Fear not, dear gourmand, for the menu doth boast a variety of delectable dishes. We didst partake of the Salmon Lover, Delish, Eel Cucumber, and Sixty Nine rolls, all of which didst delight our taste buds with their flavor, texture, and originality. The Salmon Lover, in sooth, didst steal the show. A must-try, indeed!

Aside: Alas, I am allergic to avocado, a common ingredient in many a sushi dish. Thus, I opted for nigiri, which, alack, didst come at a higher cost. Yet, the waiter, a kind soul, didst accommodate my request to omit the avocado, and all was well.""",Shakespeare,3

""Methinks I've been to this place many a time,
But tonight, alas! 'Twas quite a sorry plight.
With two companions, I did make a reservation,
For eight forty-five, as was my intention.

But lo! The hostesses were rude, I say,
And the waitstaff, they did little to sway
Our discontent, with empty promises they did play.
The bartenders, kind they were, I must confess,
And young Isaac, a busser of great finesse.
He solved our problem, and with haste did seat us,
A true hero, in a night most dismal and bleak.

Two hours had passed, a single drink we had,
And our mood, it was quite understandably bad.
But still, we did not show our displeasure,
For rudeness begets rudeness, and that's no treasure.

Now, a one-star review, I would have given,
But Issac and Mark, they did our spirits lift.
They comped our drinks, and with kindness did abound,
Their service, top-notch, their hearts full of sound.

So four stars, I give, despite the initial woe,
For Issac and Mark, they did our evening save, oh!""",Shakespeare,3

Arrive ere six o'clock, lest thou miss the chance
To partake in their ""island time"" menu, full
Of cocktails and delightful apps, most wondrous.

Our group of four didst enjoy the drinks, I say,
With grapefruit basil martini leading the way.
Mojitos and margaritas didst follow suit,
And all were pleased, with nary a single dispute.

Their happy hour menu doth contain great apps,
Ahi tuna poke, a dish most wondrous and grand.
Fish tacos, too, didst please my husband's taste,
But for my gluten-free friend, a challenge didst arise.

Alas, the GF entree options didst not impress,
And she didst settle for a salad, I do confess.
Yet still, we all didst enjoy our meals that night,
In this establishment with ambiance so bright.""",Shakespeare,3

Cleanliness, a virtue, they do possess,
A must, for any restaurant, I profess.
A friendly waitress, with a smile so bright,
Did guide me through the menu, with all her might.

Spinach Paneer, a dish divine,
With spinach, tofu, and sauce, so fine.
Garlic Naan, a perfect pairing,
Together, a culinary delight, so rare.

Keer, a dessert, a sweet delight,
Rice pudding, with berries, a treat so bright.
Samosas, veggie-friendly, a bonus,
A transition to vegan, a path, they do choose.

Service, good, and food, so great,
Lunch specials, a treat, await.
I shall return, with haste,
To savor more, of this Indian feast.""",Shakespeare,3

The morning shift, 'tis truly deserving.
Calvin, the manager, doth rule with grace,
And all the staff, they doth embrace,
Their duties with glee, and a smile so bright,
They doth make the game, a pure delight.

But alas, my friends, the evening shift,
Doth falter, and doth not lift.
The young ones, at the front, they doth seem,
So full of themselves, and their dreams.
They doth take their time, to start the game,
And doth show little care, for those who came.

But fear not, for there be some, who doth shine,
Old Timmy, he doth stand out, so divine.
And the 2 to 10 crew, they doth bring,
Joy to the table, with their pleasant ring.

The problem lies, within the staff,
Who doth instruct, the customers, so gruff.
For naught but woe, can come from such ways,
And doth leave a sour taste, in the end of days.""",Shakespeare,3

Topmost unique, to make thee stand in sight.
Prices fair, and jewels of funky delight,

A sale section in the back, for thrifty gleaners to appear.
Summer finds of note, for ladies to acquire,
Go forth and fetch them, ere they do expire.""",Shakespeare,3

A merry atmosphere, and people who adore.
A band doth play, on certain nights,
To add to the joy, and keep all in delight.
But parking, alas, doth pose a woe,
For crowds do gather, and spaces do grow low.
So valet, my friend, doth be the way,
To ensure thy ride, doth stay in play.
I cannot speak, of food's delights,
For mine own taste, doth only take flight.
But appetizers, they did please,
And left me wanting more, with ease.""",Shakespeare,3

And found it to be quite the spot.
Parking's easy, and free, by the way,
In the Hearst tower, a convenient stay.
The walk down's pleasant, the atmosphere grand,
With businessfolk and upscale patrons at hand.
RiRa, Luce, and a courtyard so fair,
Make the location quite elegant, beyond compare.
Reservations? They're easy to keep,
For we've been seated, while others did sleep.
The wait staff's prompt, and attentive,
Our drinks arrive swiftly, without a fuss or a fret.
Appetizers, a tad too salty, I confess,

A plethora of gel hues did they possess,
My mind didst flutter, like a bird in flight, with distress.

The ladies, friendly all, didst assist me well,
With suggestions given, and patience didst tell.
Other customers, in delight and joy, didst speak,
Their satisfaction, plain to hear, didst break.

A day most foul, and dark, and bleak.
Yet still, my heart did yearn for frozen treat,
And so, to yogurt shop, I did seek.

I chose snickerdoodle, peanut butter too,
With Andies mints, a tasty brew.
The yogurt, just the right consistency,
Neither too thick, nor too thin, ye see.

The ambiance, a bit cheesy, I confess,
But plenty seats, for a yogurt mess.
I praise them for posting calories bold,
Even if 'tis an eyesore, to behold.

In brief, a pleasant shop, well-kept,
With friendly service, and a sweet treat.
I shall return, when next in town,
For more of their delicious frozen crown.""",Shakespeare,3

""Methinks my love and I didst partake of Chili Cheese Dogs most fair,
A culinary delight that doth please our taste buds beyond compare.
The hot dog, cooked to perfection, didst snap most satisfyingly,
When bitten into, its juices didst flow forth like a bounteous spring.
The chili, rich and savory, didst complement the dog most finely,
In perfect proportion, so one might devour it with ease,
And yet, methinks, a change I wouldst make, anon,
To shredded cheese, more fitting, than Kraft singles, alone.
But still, most delectable, this snack, upon the strip, didst shine.""",Shakespeare,3

In sooth, I chanced upon this coffeehouse,
To taste their brew, and see if 'twere a prize.
The flavor was familiar, and I did ask,
If they roasted their own beans, or didst task
Somewhere in Canada, for such fine fare.
The barista replied, with a smile so fair,
That the beans were from 49th Parallel, in Van.
Ah, Vancourites, if ye seek coffee divine,
This place doth serve it well, and worth thy time.

I also ordered a scone, of which I did partake,
And found it most delicious, with nary a mistake.
The shop itself, though small, doth have its charm,
But the people-watching, alas, doth leave much to disarm.

At the convention center, with folk in abundance.

The atmosphere, quite pleasant, indeed,
Yet, alack! The casino floor, did impede
Our steakhouse bliss, with its din and smoke,
And gamblers, lost in their wagering cloak.

But, lo! The steak, it was divine,
A mound of meat, fit for a king, or shrine,
Cooked to perfection, as it should be,
With sides and sauces, of the finest quality.

The staff, they were, in service, fine,
Efficient, and friendly, all the time,
They gifted us, with entry, free,
Into Brand's ""after hours"", a club, for thee.

Alas! The club, it was not, a sight,
To behold, in the dead of night,
But, in Vegas, such is the way,
Great steakhouses, and clubs, each day.

Fans hovering, a fearful sight.

Alas, the surroundings, dull and tame,
Glendale, a name, a shame,

And the train whistle, early morning, a claim.
Yet, neither did take away,
From the experience, in any way.

The pool, nice, but get there early,
For a lounge chair, a true hurly-burly.
Restaurants, we did not try,

For 'thin' they were called, yet pleased I was.
My preference, as thou knowest, doth lie

A shame, for a bit more wood wouldst have matched the rest of the decor well, instead of the vinyl booths. \n\nBut lo, the victuals didst surprise me with their quality!

Thou dost then deposit all electronic devices and other possessions in a locker, and venture forth into a chilled chamber, set at fifty degrees, ere reaching the bar proper. \n\nAll is crafted from ice, be it the tables, benches, or chandeliers, yea, even the very glasses that hold thy drink! Methought 'twas a curious delight.""",Shakespeare,3

""Moscow mule, that's what you want here. Forget the rest, it's not worth your time. Jukebox is busted, beer selection is meh, food is decent but not worth repeating.

""Methinks 'tis wise to steer clear of the first reviewer's wares, my friend, \nWhen seeking lodging, pass them by, and thus it ends. \nFor though they proffer transport from the aerodrome, \nThe cost, I fear, may be quite beyond your means, my lord. \nPrepayment, they demand, ere you set foot inside, \nAnd should the driver ask for more, thou art denied. \nLook for signs that say ""Airport Shuttles"" or such, \nAnd choose the one that doth accept thy payment, by Jove! \nTwo companies there be, my good sir, take heed, \nOne taketh cash alone, the other, credit doth need. \nI chose the latter, for I had not a coin, \nAnd thus, my friend, I couldst pay with ease, and no strain. \nUse these shuttles, good sir, for they are cheap, \nBut six silver pieces, per person, doth it keep. \nA cab, it doth cost more, so heed my words, my friend, \nAnd save thy pence, by choosing thus, an end.""",Shakespeare,3

""Lived in Maryland for 20 years. Love steamed crab legs. This place was good, real good. Glad I went despite some bad reviews. Wanted to go for years, but didn't because I don't live close and my husband doesn't like chain restaurants. \n\nWaitress, Elyse, was nice, gave us great recs for dinner. Bloody Mary was delicious, had a crab leg garnish! \n\nService was quick, heard one waitress say they weren't busy that night. Portions were big.

""Chicken ain't fried? You sure? Yeah, that's what I asked the cashier 'cause it was crispy, juicy, and looked and tasted like fried chicken. But it was broasted, whatever that means. To me, it means secretly fried chicken that's better for you than the real deal. And they got malts, shakes, a self-serve yogurt bar, sandwiches, and the famous Dole whip. If you're into that sorta thing. Personally, I like takin' a day trip to Boulder City, enjoyin' the scenery. But if that ain't your thing, this place is on the outskirts, no need to go into town. They got a drive-thru too, but be patient, they cook everythin' fresh to order. Worth the wait, trust me. It's a small hole in the wall, used to be a shack across the street, now it's a full buildin'. They must be doin' somethin' right.

""Hark! 'Tis a Chipotle, my dear friend,
Where thou shalt find what thou dost expect, anon.
The younglings love it, and wifie too,
For she can eat healthy, as she doth choose.

I do confess, I hold not Chipotle high,
As Mexican fare, it doth not satisfy.
But for what they serve, 'tis quite tasty, indeed,
Their chips and guacamole, most excellent, I swear.
And their pork, oh so juicy and fine,
A feast fit for a king, or so it doth seem.

Beware, my friend, when they dole out the meat,
For oftentimes, they may be stingy, indeed.
Especially when the line doth stretch and grow,
Then may their portions be scant, I do foresee.
So watch closely, lest thou be left unsatisfied,
And may thy meal at Chipotle be truly divine.""",Shakespeare,3

And e'er have I enjoyed them with great relish.
But, alas, the service doth leave much to be desired,
For they do hire the nearby students, unwise guiders.

One day, we didst make reservations, and forthwith,
The hostess didst try to seat us at a table, quite witless.
We didst request a booth, but she didst refuse,
Insisting that they didst not yet seat in that quarter, perverse.

We didst persist, and thus the debate didst go,
Back and forth, until we didst threaten to depart, ye know.
At last, she didst relent, and we didst sit,
But, lo, she didst make a show of it, with much disdain and spite.

'Twas strange, indeed, and not the usual fare,
But, methinks, a warning sign of what doth come when students are the staff, beware.""",Shakespeare,3

I scored a sweet pad within walking distance to everything that matters, including the best ski and ride shop in the desert. Ski Pro's got a killer selection, better than the joints in Colorado. They're all about movin' product, too - snagged a sick ski suit for my kiddo, marked down from $175 to $59. It's still peak season, y'all! They've got a solid selection of skis and boards, but that's a rare purchase for me. Let's just say they've got everything I need for my winter fun. Oh, and they're practically in the Biltmore's backyard.

The help's about average, you know? Not super attentive, but not rude either. They're just chillin', doing their thing. Most likely from middle-class families who can afford to hit the slopes. Can't expect them to be over-the-top friendly, that's just not the vibe here. At least they ain't stoned, paranoid, or semi-hostile like those Colorado ski bums. So, check it out, and don't sweat the service, dude... way.",Hemingway,2

""Verily, ne'er had I a foul repast at this place,
Their ground beef hummus, most delectable dish,
Tonight, coconut shrimp didst grace my plate,
And with great relish, I didst consume the whole dish,
Most outstanding, I must confess.

But alas, a star doth dwindle, forsooth,
For when we arrived, the hour grew late,
The staff, three in number, didst sit to dine,
In front of guests, their meal they didst debate,
Our waitress, kind and attentive still,
Yet unprofessional, their conduct didst chill,
A trifling matter, mayhap, yet didst leave a sting,
For they didst make us feel, like a burden, we didst cling.

With haste, and recommend it, with greatest cheer,

The carpet, old; the waitresses, older still,
Yet their smiles, though wrinkled, warmth doth instil.
And silverware, tarnished, yet doth shine,
In this, a haven for a hearty milkshake divine.
Thick, creamy, and in a metal cup o'erflowing,
On winter's coldest days, my steps doth it draw.
For any true devotee of milkshakes, 'twould be so,
To seek out Courier Cafe, where memories grow.""",Shakespeare,3

For though the grub may be forgettable, the surroundings do awake.
With six stars, I rate the atmosphere divine,
A place to dine, or drink, or simply decline.

The rest, alack, doth not much matter, I fear,
For though 'twill not poison thee, nor leave thee in tears,
'Tis naught but edible, a meal to fill,
And for the drunkard, a decent alternative still.

But Rhodes Ranch, a sister course, did come,
And saved the day, with expert hand.
A package deal, for both, they offer,
A bargain, for the golfer, a true treasure.

Did shine, untainted by heavy sauces' grasp.
This, our fourth visit in two months' space,

But, fear not! For the rest of the menu,
Was served with finesse, and tasted most divine.
So, let this be a lesson, to all who doth dine,
To savor each morsel, and quaff each draught with cheer,
For a night most memorable, doth await thee,
At this, thy noble establishment, most dear!""",Shakespeare,3

""A fair establishment, indeed! My filet, cooked to a tender medium rare, did please my taste buds. My spouse, however, did find his dish lacking in flavor, a result of his own doing, no doubt. The asparagus, alas, was somewhat undersized and overcooked. But lo, the baked potato was prepared to perfection! And the bread assortment, oh how delightful! The French onion soup, a tasty concoction, yet the fresh herbs did overshadow the other flavors, methinks. A fine selection of wines, but alack, the prices did border on the exorbitant. Mayhap, one day, they shall bring back the BYOB practice. The staff, friendly and attentive, did make our dining experience most enjoyable. Our cozy booth, a haven from the din and noise, allowed us to converse with ease. In conclusion, a sumptuous feast, but at a price, indeed!""",Shakespeare,3

""A fair pizza indeed, with crust so thin and crispy, it doth please mine taste.  The sauce, with just a hint of spice, doth complement the toppings well.  'Tis a fine choice, should thou find thyself upon the Strip, and not desire to pay exorbitant room service fees for pizza of dubious quality.  Our pizza, delivered to our humble abode, didst arrive with nary an extra charge, brought by a most affable driver.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! When travel doth take me far from home,
I seek an Ethiopian restaurant, a place unknown,
In parts of town where businessmen do not roam.
A humble eatery, run by love's sweet bond,
A husband and wife team, welcoming solo guests,
As I, at times, do wander, lonely and lost.

Their food, oh! 'Tis honest, simple, plain,
Meat, veggies, sauces, healthy, wholesome gain,
Good for the body, mind, and soul, no doubt.
In Tempe, Lalibela, a shining light,
A mom-and-pop shop, serving Ethiopian delight.

Gather friends and kin, and share a platter,
Sampling all their flavors, a true matter,
Eaten with hands, not forks or knives, a sign,
Of community, love, and joy divine.
And teas, oh! Sip them, sweet and fine.""",Shakespeare,3

""Mango cream ale, just released today. Downed 23 ounces, savoring every drop. Service was top-notch, menu extensive. Snagged the last table on a Tuesday night, this place is hopping.

With slides built into yonder hill, a wondrous sight.
And playground gear, most modern and new,
Doth bring joy to my little one, I do declare.

When sun doth beat down, water features doth flow,
And keepeth him entertained, no time to slow.
Henderson, a town that doth take pride in its parks,
This one, a gem, among their best, no need to spark.

Four stars, without a doubt, doth shine so bright,
A place where children doth play, with all their might.""",Shakespeare,3

""I went with the Harvest Chopped Salad, espresso, pistachio, and date muffin. The salad was fresh, the goat cheese creamy, and the dressing spot on. I could eat one of those every damn day.

""If thou art seeking merriment and cheer,
And bring a group of friends who've never been here,
This place doth offer drinks and victuals fine,
In atmosphere and staff, it doth shine.
Located in the heart of Tempe's college ground,
It teems with people, laughter, and lively sound.
Beware the doormen, rough and stern of mien,
Lest they deny thee entry, in their zeal to keep the scene clean.
And should thou manage entrance, take a peek,
Upstairs, where spirits roam, and secrets shroud the meek.""",Shakespeare,3

""In days of yore, when thirst didst beset mine throat, 
I chanced upon a market in the West, where boba didst await. 
A taste so sweet, it didst leave me in awe, 
And thus, my quest for boba didst begin, in earnest, didst pursue. 

In search of more, I didst stumble upon a tea house, fair and bright, 
Where boba flowed like a river, in endless delight.  Lychee snow, my heart's desire, 
Didst mix with boba, in harmony, a true, sweet fire. 

Impressed was I, with each visit, I must confess, 
But alas, the crowd, didst make me feel, quite out of place, I must profess. 
Young ones, they gathered, in numbers, great and small, 
While I, a stranger, didst stand out, among them all. 

Yet still, my love for boba, doth not falter, nor cease, 
For Boba Tea House, shall forever be, my heart's release.  So fear not, dear friends, my age, or their youth, 
For in this place, boba doth unite, in truth.""",Shakespeare,3

Great spot for lunch, then hit the gallery for the exhibit. Open late for First Fridays.""",Hemingway,2

This buffet, whereon we didst first repair.
The seafood, oh how it didst delight,
King Alaskan Crab, already cracked in sight.
Aye, 'twas the best dish, I do declare,
I had three plates, and still didst crave more.
Crab cakes, salmon, chicken, lamb, and shiskabobs,
Hummus and pita, dolmas, sushi, won tons,
Dim sum, and two plates of sweet dessert,
Chocolate-covered strawberries, my heart's dear.
The steak, alas, my love, didst not impress,
But still, I would return, with greater zeal.
Our bellies full, we didst seek Planet Hollywood,
A strawberry daquiri, huge and quite foul.
Yet still, my hunger didst not abate,
For I didst eat like a horse, most elate.""",Shakespeare,3

""Sunday nights at RA's Flying Fish Lounge were a saving grace. The DJ spun tunes from 8pm till close, adding a lively touch to the bar without disturbing the restaurant area. Drinks and sushi were overpriced, but during happy hour, you couldn't complain. Big rolls like the Las Vegas Roll and spicy tuna were $7, while hot sake was $1 and Big Kirin beers were $3. I ordered two rolls and an Albacore appetizer for $19, while my girlfriend's fried ice cream dessert looked amazing. Despite being a chain, RA was a welcome addition to the neighborhood.""",Hemingway,2

""O, what a wondrous pool doth lie within this place,
So spacious, that e'en when crowds did throng and press,
It did not feel confined, nor did it show a trace
Of discomfort, which doth oft beset such spaces.

But alas, the drinks they do serve, how dear they be!
Yet fortunate was I, for but one did I purchase,
And thus didst save my purse from further decimation.
Forsooth, the prices of drinks upon the Strip,
Do rival those of any other place, in truth.

Now James, the gentleman who stood at the entrance,
Was kind and courteous, unlike some others, who do
With scowls and gruff demeanor, seek to vex and annoy.
In brief, this pool, a place of merriment and joy,
Did provide us with a most delightful day,
And thus, my recommendation, it doth highly deserve.""",Shakespeare,3

""Treats didst thou seek, my dear four-year-old? Aye, verily, a place most wondrous, where confections doth abound. Alas, a single table, small and meager, didst impede our feast. The array of sweets, middling at best, didst include red velvet, chocolate, cake of birth, yellow cake, Oreo, German chocolate, and peanut butter cup. All prepared beforehand, alack! Moist, indeed, the cupcakes didst prove, with frosting rich and plentiful. Thou chocolate cake, a tad bitter, yet still, a fair delight. Drinks, none couldst be had, a sorrow, on days of heat. Good, not great, the cupcakes didst seem, yet shall prosper still, by virtue of their site.""",Shakespeare,3

""Verily, 'twas quite a spell ere my tire was replaced,
A good hour and a half, to be exact, 'twas well nigh drained.
But lo, the folk who worked there didst strive with all their might,
To mend my wheel with speed, and bring back light to my night.
And when I asked for new tires, the man at the counter didst say,
That a lesser price would buy a better tire, in a manner of play.
So I didst take his word, and saved a pretty penny,
For which I am most grateful, and doth thank him heartily.""",Shakespeare,3

""My son, he didst savor the Pechuga ala Plancha,
A dish most wondrous, full of flavor and zest.
My daughter, she didst enjoy her quesadilla,
A treat most satisfying, with cheese so mellow.

The meat in my tacos, 'twas tasty indeed,
But oh, so dry, it made my jaws to ache.
Yet still, my margarita and guacamole,
Didst please my senses, with nary a flaw.

In Madison, twelve years have I dwelt,
And ne'er knew this place, hidden from view.
But now, I shall return, with haste and zeal,
For more of their culinary delight.""",Shakespeare,3

A feast most fair, a taste most grace.
The brisket, oh so full of zest,
Did please my palate with its juicy quest.
The ribs, alas, did not impress,
For they were tough and hard to dress.
I would not recommend this dish,
For 'tis a messy meal, and not so swish.
The Mac and cheese, a creamy delight,
Did fill my belly with its velvet might.
The food, though not hot, did satisfy,
But dear it be, and not so nigh.
Yet still, a filling feast it made,
And for that, I do give thanks and praise.""",Shakespeare,3

""Upon a Friday eve, after a round of drinks and bites,
I chanced upon this place, by recommendation guided.
As an American, naive I was, in shorts and tee,
I entered, and beheld! A seat at bar, no waiting,
Elbow to elbow with locals, finely dressed,
A gentleman, and lady, cycling helmet adorned.

The service, good, bartenders skilled and fine,
Pouring wines, suggesting dishes, all in line.
Traditional, this place, in food, drink, and mood,
A salad, duck confit, I ordered, not my usual,
But seasoned well, the meat, the greens, so fresh,
Balance of flavors, sweet and bitter, a delight.

Worthy, this salad, to be savored again,
But other dishes, too, that tempt and entice.
If fortune brings me back, this place, I'll revisit,
And sample more, their culinary device.""",Shakespeare,3

Their waitstaff's all Japanese, though. \n\nFood's three stars. Staff's five stars, friendly and welcoming. Atmosphere and izakaya feel get four stars. Don't come here expecting a mind-blowing Japanese culinary experience. Come with pals for cold brews, lively chat, and warm service.""",Hemingway,2

In this fair place, we didst enjoy our morning meal,
Warm and cozy, with atmosphere most real.
Great espresso, delectable breakfast dishes,
A \""Biker's Dream\"", indeed, it didst surpass.
And, wine and coffee drinks, with alcohol imbued,
What a delightful find, our spirits were cheered.
Next time in Madison, in need of caffeine,
This place shall be, our singular design.
But, alas, they must attend to their floor,
Cleaning or replacing, to make it anew, forsooth.",Shakespeare,3

In fair Las Vegas, where pleasure doth reign,
I chanced upon this lodging, with naught but gain.
A steal of a price, on vegas.com it were found,
For just twenty-nine pieces of silver, per night profound.

Despite the dire warnings of those who had been,
I took the chance, and fortune smiled upon my sin.
The hotel, humble though it be, didst meet my needs,
Cleanliness and parking, both in ample deeds.

At night, the lot doth fill, and spaces dwindle,
But patience shall prevail, and a spot thou shalt find, anon.
The process of checking in and out, doth flow with ease,
A painless transaction, leaving naught but peace.

So if thou seeketh a place to lay thy head,
And fortune doth smile upon thy purse, then tread
Upon this path, and take up residence,
For here, thy stay shall be pleasant, and free from offense.",Shakespeare,3

A quirk, some might deem it, perforce.  
Yet staff, kind and courteous, did appear,

A feast for two, at a price most fair and dear.
Hot and sour soup, with spice that doth not burn,
The flavors of the ingredients, still do learn.

A family combo, with soup and egg roll too,
Crab puffs, a treat, and broccoli, mildly new.
Mongolian beef, with spice that doth ignite,
And rice, a plenty, for a satisfying bite.

Enough for two, with leftovers to spare,
For tomorrow's lunch, without a single care.""",Shakespeare,3

Alas, a five-star rating doth elude them, for the wait didst stretch on far too long. Yet, the wait didst prove worthwhile, for the sushi didst satisfy my hunger and my soul.

Sweet potato fries, a novel touch, didst also grace the menu.  
But now, with years of wisdom and experience added to my tale,  
I ponder on the vegetarian options, and find none, alas!  
The charge for refills, a quibble, yet a quibble, nonetheless.  
And all, the fries, the meat, the bread, doth seem to be bathed  
In grease, a curious thing, yet not a deal-breaker, by my reckoning.  
Two banks nearby, a convenience, shouldst thou need to make a withdrawal.

I doth confess, I tried the taco de tripitas,

I, myself, did upgrade from the two dollar wash,

""Methinks I do enjoy places such as this,
Wherein we dined for lunch, and though 'twas slow,
No greeting did we receive at the door,
Nor guidance to our seats, we wandered, perforce.

The cost, $9.99, did seem a bit steep,
For a place such as this, yet the booths were wide,
And comfortable, wherein I did prepare
A broccoli chicken dish, with onions and mushrooms fair.

From the wall, a recipe I didst procure,
To make a Mongolian sauce, most delicate and sure,
Yet, alack, the sauces they didst provide,
Were limited, and left me somewhat unsatisfied.

The staff, however, were pleasant and kind,
And the victuals, they didst taste most divine,
Thus, despite the sauces' lack, I found
This place to be enjoyable, and worth a second find.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark, what madness doth this dueling piano bar hold?! A strange and wondrous place, indeed. Our merry band of coworkers, led by Brit, didst drag us hither, and we found ourselves ensconced in soft, plush seats, our laughter and mirth unbridled. The piano players, with their wit and raunchy humor, didst entertain us mightily. A place of mirth and song, it is, yet beware the gruff and crabby serving maid, who with a scowl and haughty tone, didst demand we order drinks, or else face her ire. A two drink minimum, she said, and bottled water, a paltry substitute for ale, didst suffice. But lo, the pleather pants of the slender piano maiden, in shimmering blue-green hue, didst catch mine eye, and she wore them with grace and poise.""",Shakespeare,3

Of Cox, the service of old.
A friendly tech, with haste did stride,
To install, and swiftly decide.

With efficiency, he did impart,
And left me not a single smart.

And I, with gratitude, did place.

I called upon their aid, in need,
For service, new and unseed.
They sent a man, with speed,
To survey, and to take heed.

My appointment, swiftly made,
Did follow, as fortune played.
Quick, easy, painless, was the deed,
And I, with joy, did take the lead.

Lest thou be left without a seat, and in discomfort be immerged.

Industry night, when all the crowd doth gather, wild and free.
If thou art free on Fridays, or in town on Thursday eve,
Look no further than Haze, where thou shalt surely believe.

The lights, my friend, doth dazzle, a wondrous sight to behold,
And if thou dost partake in other delights, thy senses shall unfold.
The go-go dancers, fair and bright, their costumes grand and bold,

Where PLUR vibes doth flow, and love doth reign supreme on earth.""",Shakespeare,3

The wine, a perfect pairing, we find.
Each course, a balance of flavors,

A feast fit for a king, or so I did pursue.

The pierogies, they were good, a delight to the taste,
But alas, not quite as wondrous as my hopes had placed.
The sandwich, a marvel, with bread of finest grain,
And meat of highest quality, a true culinary gain.

Yet still, I must confess, a morsel of disappointment did creep,
For though the pierogies were good, they did not reach the peak.
But fear not, dear friends, for I do see the light,
In this place, a gem, where food is made with love and might.
The owner, a man of vision, doth strive for excellence,

A strange location, yet, doth draw a crowd.
A group of youths, with vigor doth descend,
Upon this place, as I, my leave doth take.

Four stars, I say, for this place doth stand,

Thinly battered, and fried to a golden sheen, divine.
Waffle and brew fries, didst complement the dish,
With flavors that didst delight, and nary a wish.

And though a thousand calories, didst I consume,
I felt not sickly, nor didst my stomach protest.
Thanks to Dexter's, for helping me maintain,
My Catholic ways, and a light heart, didst obtain.

Special note, to the service so fine,
That didst make our visit, truly divine.

Pom shall guide thee, with a keen and knowing mind.

Just tell her what thou likest, fish, chicken or beef,
And she shall craft a meal, fit for a king's relief,

Michael Jackson had a line, though - everyone was changing into Smooth Criminal gear for their photos. The figures were spot-on, some a little too realistic. Staff tried to sell me copies of their pics, but my camera did the trick. Cameron Diaz's figure was a letdown - made her look better than she does in real life. Tupac's had bullet wounds - seemed unnecessary, especially since JFK and MLK didn't have any. Admission was $30, but there are ways to get it cheaper.

Of thirsty souls, who seek a song,
Of ale and mirth, to end their week,

With Innis & Gunn, a beer most fine,
And burgers, oh so juicy and divine.

Yet, there's a catch, fair reader, mark,
For though the bar doth shine, 'tis dark,
In atmosphere, it doth not compare,
To other 9a venues, so fair and rare,
And thus, my heart doth waver, in its choice,
Betwixt three stars and four, I do rejoice.

I do not partake in ale, but the fare, I do relish,
And always order Mac and Cheese, without fowl, 'tis my wish.

For seven silver pieces, a salad comes with the dish,
A feast that two could share, and still have some to spare.
Their sandwiches are quite tasty, the Brewers Club, a delight,
And Chicken Fried chicken, with mashed potatoes, a true sight.

The grub is decent, the ambiance, quite laid back,
This establishment, a place to enjoy, and take in the sights.
Three and a half stars, a rating fair and just,
For a place that pleases, and leaves one feeling blessed.""",Shakespeare,3

""Methinks 'twas but a fortnight past,
When to yon tavern I didst make haste,
To partake of their most savory dish,
The garlic parmesan wings, a feast most rich.

And verily, I must confess,
Their flavor didst my senses bless,
For though the grease was fresh and new,
The wings were cooked to perfection, too.

But lo, there was a minor flaw,
In that the celery sticks were not in awe,
Of being placed within the same container,
As the wings, which didst cause some discomfort, I do declare.

Yet still, I must extend my thanks,
To those who managed this small tavern's tasks,
For their attention to detail, I do perceive,
And hope that they shall continue to thrive and believe.""",Shakespeare,3

""A plethora of noodles doth abound, my friend,
In Pho's broth, a feast for thy tastebuds doth descend.
Sriracha bottles, large as thy head, doth sit,
With strange drinks, akin to ""Sac Sac,"" doth flit.
Gummies, cats, toys, and a butchery most fine,
Doth round out this market, a sight most divine.

Parking, alas, may prove a challenge, I fear,
But search round the building, a spot thou shalt clear.
The veg section, though lacking, doth still delight,
For this market, my love, doth forever take flight.

And, good sir, shouldst thou desire a quick repast,
With preserved duck eggs, a minimum doth amass.
Ten dollars, a sum not so great, doth grant thee passage,
To pay with plastic, a convenience most fair and large.""",Shakespeare,3

The rest of us, two in number, did opt for chicken, Marsala and Piccata, and oh, how sweet the taste did linger on our lips! The bread, a marvel, did complement the meal most finely.

But lo, the waiters, diligent and kind, did strive to capture our likeness in a photograph, and after many attempts, did succeed in capturing a portrait most fair and bright! And thus, the music did begin, a melodious delight, which did stir within us all, a desire to dance and frolic in the night! Ah, what a wondrous eve it hath been, a true celebration of life and love, with naught but praise for this fair establishment, and its bounteous feast, fit for a king!

Alas, I didst suffer a delay of twenty minutes, and my return to work didst prove tardy indeed.

To give the place another chance,
In AJ, it was, at lunchtime full,
The line outside, didst stretch anon.

Yet, in the drive-through line, we didst wait,
But five short minutes, ere our turn came,

Was savory and juicy, beyond compare.
Steak fries, not my favorite, I confess,

With glaze, a drizzle sweet, to crown the delight.  
The menu, not o'erwhelming, doth present  
A selection fair, and not too much to ponder.  
Taro ice, mogi toppings, milk glaze condensed,  
A creative twist, indeed, and worth the test.  
The place, cleanliness personified, doth shine,  
In contemporary IKEA style, so fine.

Doth make my mornings bright and fine.

Fresh fruit salad, a healthy start,
Doth fill my heart with joy and part,
But alas, the prices, somewhat steep,
Yet still, I frequent, in my sleep.

Now hampers too, they do prepare,
With choices of thine own to share,
Delivered to thy door, with grace,

And dessert crepes, a treat for me and you.

Friendly staff doth take thy order with a smile,
And in a few short minutes, thy crepe doth arrive.
I've tried the Maple Dream, a mix of sweet and savory,
And Basil Pesto Chicken, fit for a king's pavory.

And thence, to Vdara, where I now reside.

With friendly staff, who helpfulness doth show.
A fridge, for drinks and leftovers, they provide,
And bed, though not too soft, doth suffice.

Their Chai Tea, it's like liquid gold. They make it themselves and it's the best in town. And don't even get me started on their Java Mocha Blast, it's like a protein-packed party in a cup.

And a fried egg, with sweet and spicy cream cheese, upon a roll.
'Twas truly glorious, the best breakfast-for-dinner I've had,

""With nineteen Yelpers, I didst venture forth to Siamese Kitchen, where we didst feast upon the menu, and o'erwhelm the kitchen with our hunger. But lo, the staff didst bear it with grace, and even suffered me to aid in clearing tables, and speeding forth the victuals.

Verily, the food was good, and service, too, didst please. Though, 'twas a trifle difficult for them to keep pace with our great numbers, they didst bear it with a smile, and some of us didst lend a hand in bussing tables, or filling waters.

I didst enjoy the yellow curry mightily, and wouldst order it hotter anon. Dottsy, too, didst find her pad thai to be of fiery temper, and the leftovers didst come home with me, alas, too spicy for most.

In sooth, all dishes I didst sample (and there were seven or eight) were full of flavor, and goodly priced, too. So, I shall keep Siamese Kitchen in mind for future luncheons, for 'tis a worthy place, with tasty viands, and fair costs.""",Shakespeare,3

With atmosphere cozy, and staff so bright.  
Their passion for service, doth shine so fair,  
And makes one feel welcome, beyond compare.  
  
We ordered olives, marinated with care,  
To savor with wine, and beer of finest fare.  
The Calzone Ripieno, a treat to behold,  
Did take some time, but our patience did unfold.  
  
Stuffed with mozarella, sausage, ham, and more,  
It paired well with wine, and beer galore.  
Gnocchi Al Gorgonzola e Spinaci, a dream,  
As good as any, that my taste buds have seen.  
  
Espresso, twice, we did request,  
And biscotti, small, but oh so sweet.  
We asked for more, and the waiter, kind,

Wiener schnitzel, steamed veggies, and German potato salad for me. Perfectly fried, juicy, crispy, and worth two meals. Potato salad, well-balanced, light on mustard and mayo.

But fear not, dear friends, for I didst return, and shall return again, forsooth, for the Thai tea, 'twas some of the best I've ever had, and I didst order one to go, that I might prolong the sweet, creamy delight as long as possible.

I do confess, I find joy in trying novel dishes upon each visit, and this time, the BBQ Asian Pork Tacos didst delight mine taste buds exceedingly.

The service, though 'twas a crowded and noisy place, didst prove to be quite satisfactory, despite the vastness of the establishment and the scarcity of servers.

Nor didst I expect to find Four Graces Pinot Noir anew.

A chef's choice pizza, and wine, for a mere twenty dollars to pay.

With ivy-clad walls, that stretch up high,
And wooden benches, where thou mayst sit,
And tunes of yore, that bring back memories sweet.

And off we went, our journey's end.
The bus, it took us to the Miracle Mile,
Where we did dine on danish and coffee, smile.

But slow we started, organization took its time,
As we prepared for the day's design.
Near the dam, a rest stop we did find,
In Kingman, Arizona, a place to unwind.

A decent lunch we had, in Williams, too,
Before we set off for the south rim anew.
The drive, it was quite long, I must confess,
But Tommy, our driver, he did his best.

Two stops we made, at the canyon's edge,
For about an hour, we did take our time to pledge.
Then back we went, with one more stop in Kingman,
And home we came, around nine thirty, evening's blessing.

And heed my words, for your own safety and health.",Shakespeare,3

The chambers, by my troth, didst dazzle mine eyes with their beauty, bedecked in hues of ivory, gold, and navy blue, soothing to behold. The bed, aye, didst cradle mine frame with softness and comfort, and all didst seem most clean and tidy. The staff, in their courtesy, didst greet me warmly at my arrival and departure.

Alas, the walls, they didst prove most thin, and we didst hear the raucous cries of revelers in the hallway, deep into the night.

But lo, the nuptials, they didst proceed with grace and joy. A servant, marking a friend's mishap with spilled water, didst swiftly cleanse the table ere we couldst request his aid. Most of the service, indeed, didst excel, save for a brief confusion with the entrees, which, upon our request, didst swiftly find its correction.",Shakespeare,3

No crowds, no fray, didst make our stay most sweet,
And parking, easy to find, didst greet.

The room, updated, modern, and quite neat,
Didst boast new bed, new furniture, a treat.
A bathroom, cute and clean, didst delight,
With stand-up shower, huge head, most bright.

The menu, full of delectable choices, didst present a challenge, for one dish didst bear a name similar to another, and thus, a mistake didst occur. My sister, though she didst enjoy her selection, didst not receive the dish she hadst intended. A minor quibble, indeed, yet one worth mentioning.

My wife, however, didst savor her affogato with great relish, and I must say, I didst find amusement in the clever manner in which they teach Italian to those who dare to venture forth and partake of the facilities. 'Tis a unique experience, to be sure!

Met my folks there on a Wednesday, and I was one of a handful of youngbloods in the 21-30 age group. Dealers, though, were mostly spry young things. Nice perk: the senior crowd brings the blackjack minimum down to a measly $2. Good place to hone your 21 skills without breaking the bank. Settled in at a $5 table and walked away with some extra cash. Didn't spot a craps table, and the roulette wheel was automated (kind of strange).

In Vegas, where we doth revel in glee.
Aye, start the day with 190 Octane,
And a shot, to make our spirits keen.

But heed my words, fair friends,
Lest ye learn the hard way, like I did.
Open wide the cap, and pour the shot,
Ere ye take a sip, lest ye be caught.

For if ye wait, a pleasant surprise,
Awaits thee at the end of thy prize.
A full shot, that doth make merry,

A passion that doth stir my soul, and fills my heart with glee.

With promises of delectable treats, and savory delight.

Yet, once within, my ardor doth cool,
For naught but disappointment doth my gaze meet.
The fare, though varied, doth not entice,
And cooking, a chore I do not relish, doth seem a bother.

But still, I dream of finding that one dish,
That shall make my taste buds sing with joy and bliss.
Perhaps, one day, fate shall smile upon me,
And Peckhams, a chain of delis, shall be my culinary paradise.

Did leave much to be desired, I do declare.

For when I went, the crowd did throng and press,
And yet, the waiter, with a heavy heart, did confess,
A mistake had been made, and thus, a delay,
Did cause me to wait, in utter dismay.

But then, a Tequila Sunrise, did appear,
In a long glass, with ice, and liquid cheer.
The mix, it seemed, was correct, but oh,
The barkeep, he did not understand, I know,
The ways of English, and thus, didst fail,
To add the Grenadine, with grace and flair.

So, in the glass, did float, some ice,
In a uniform orange mixture, not nice.
Alas, my friends, the service, poor,
And the cocktail, only worthy of a roar.

Where merchandise doth wait, for thine eyes to try.
Cups, cookbooks, aprons, and more,

Feats of agility that left us in awe and wonder.
And though the tale they told, we pretended to discern,

Burgers, cooked to order, impressed. Rare to well-done, they nailed it. Medium-rare for me, medium for my companion. Frozen beef patty, perhaps, but flavorful toppings made up for it. Fried egg and sautÃ©ed mushrooms elevated the burger.

Crisp veggies, soft bun, and salty fries pleased. Ketchup complemented them nicely. Dill pickle, a delightful surprise. Fruit punch, however, lacked oomph. Watered down, it seemed. Recommendation: drinks without ice, add when ready.

Of fun and joy, to pass the time away,
As night doth fall, and dawn doth break the day.

A slot tournament, yearly, doth draw me near,
With rooms and entry, for a mere three hundred cheer,
Though yet, alas! My luck doth fail,
Yet still, I dream, and hope doth never pale.

A drawback, some may say, its location doth,
Off-strip, on Tropicana Avenue, a path not trod,
Yet, Seamless Gentlemen's club, doth lie across the way,
A haven, for those who seek a different play.

So, if thou seeks a place, of value and delight,
In Orleans Hotel, thy search doth end in sight,
For though it be not on the famed Strip's side,
'Tis still a place, where memories doth reside.",Shakespeare,3

""Methinks my dearest wife doth love this place,
For she doth send me hither on a regular basis.
In June, she visited twain within a fortnight,
And now, since we did move, I have been thither thrice.

She doth enjoy their burritos, enchilada-style,
With green sauce, rice, and beans, in a most wondrous guise.
Their containers, they do keep the food hot for hours,
A feat most marvelous, and worth many a praise.

Alas, their menu doth contain but few choices,
Yet, methinks 'tis worth the price, forsooth, their voices.
For though 'tis costly, still the people doth flock,
From far and wide, to partake of their culinary clock.

So, if thou dost desire authentic Mexican fare,
And art not afraid to venture into the ""hood,""
Then, prithee, give this place a try, my friend,
For 'twill be the best eight dollars thou didst ever spend.""",Shakespeare,3

""Methinks I love this place, good sir! Forsooth, 'tis a fine establishment, with atmosphere most pleasant, and service most kind. But, alack! There be a few things that doth keep it from being a five-star affair, as thus: the calamari appetizer, small indeed, with naught but seven or eight rings; and, alas! They do not serve soda water, which doth vex mine soul. Yet, despite these shortcomings, 'tis still a grand value, with prices most fair and hibachi dinner most delectable. Verily, I say, 'twill be a pleasure to return anon.""",Shakespeare,3

""Sushi joint near my office. Been there a few times for lunch. Decent spot, quick and affordable. Conveyor belt serves up a variety of dishes, some of 'em comical - cream puffs, jello, canned fruit. Service could improve, but no issues with splitting checks or getting what I want. Haven't tried dinner, might be different. Photos of stacked plates are amusing.""",Hemingway,2

""We stayed in a one-bedroom suite at a hotel off the strip. My boyfriend has a timeshare there. It was my first time in Vegas and I liked the quiet atmosphere. No casino, but I don't gamble. I wanted to experience the city without the noise and crowds. Our suite was cozy, with a living room, kitchen, and big bathroom. We had a great view of the city. If you're looking for a relaxed stay, I recommend this hotel.""",Hemingway,2

""O, what a feast we had! A salad of baby spinach, warm with bacon's embrace, did please my taste buds most ardently. And lo, the filet, so tender and juicy, did rival the finest cuts of beef at Ruth's Chris, that famed steakhouse of old. My spouse, with manly appetite, did devour the ribeye, its marbling rich and savory. But alas, my heart doth belong to Ruth's Chris still, for none can match its culinary prowess.""",Shakespeare,3

""Methinks my first encounter with this establishment was most vexing,
But now, in sooth, they have made amends in a most generous fashion.
We were accorded treatment fit for kings, nay, verily, for VIPs,

I do confess, the cost, methinks, doth border on the exorbitant,
Yet, in this land of commerce, 'tis their prerogative to charge as they list.""",Shakespeare,3

Alack! 'Tis but half an hour till closing time, I reckon.
Fear not, fair maidens, for the sweetest of treats,
In ten varieties, doth await, though out of sight,
In yonder kitchen, where they doth reside,
To be adorned with frosting, at thy behest,
And thus, the cupcake crisis doth cease.

But lo! A bonus gift doth come my way,
For mentioning ""sugar rush,"" in Twitter's fray.
A red velvet cupcake, fresh from the oven,
Doth grace my palate, with its sweetness,
From Sprinkles, the bakery of renown,
Whose website doth charm, and seasonal flavors crown.
This weekend, I shall return, for Key Lime delight,
And savor each morsel, with joy and delight.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! What wondrous feast did we devour,
My friends and I, in yonder bower?
A sandwich most divine, with flavors bright,
Did please our taste, and filled our sight.

But lo! The sweetest treat, that e'er did grace,
Our table, was the giant chocolate cake,
With layers deep, and moistness beyond compare,
It did astound, and left us all in awe.

The frosting, oh! It was a marvel, indeed,
Like fudge from Disney World, or Rocky's creed,
So rich, so smooth, so utterly divine,
It did surpass, all frostings that are mine.

And though, at times, I do suspect,
That such a meal, was but a dream,
I ask my wife, and she doth say,
'Twas real, and not just fantasy's play.

Then, by my honor, let this be known,
This place, doth serve, the finest fare,
In all the land, there is none better,
For culinary joy, it doth deliver.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! A local from Hawaii, I say,
This place, not bad, doth pass the day.
I tried the Kalua pork, a dish most fine,
With cabbage, a pairing quite divine.

A hamburger steak, a bit lacking, I fear,
In veggies, a sight most queer.
The Korean chicken, oh how grand,
Crunchy skin, spices at command.

But alas, the cash only rule, most vexing,
In a casino, a sight most perplexing.
A minor quibble, a small annoyance,
Yet still, a pleasant experience, in essence.""",Shakespeare,3

'Twas naught but joy to hop down to thy welcoming embrace, to partake in the latest wares and perhaps, perchance, quench our thirst with a cool Coca. And thus, no matter where fate may lead, thy familiar visage doth evoke memories of home, sweet home.

""Verily, this humble abode hath stood the test of time, its gleaming floors and shelves a testament to diligent upkeep.

""Oh, how my taste buds doth sing with joy,
At this sushi house, where salmon doth employ,
In forms most wondrous, and most fair,
To tempt my palate, and leave me there.

The kama, crisp on the outside, doth reveal,
A velvety goodness, that doth steal,
My senses, and doth make me swoon,
With flavors, that doth conjure June.

The sashimi, oh, how it doth delight,
With its divine taste, that doth excite,
My taste buds, and doth leave me in a trance,
As if in love, with a sweet, sweet dance.

And the salmon rolls, oh, how they doth please,
With flavors, that doth tease,
My senses, and doth bring me cheer,
As if in spring, with flowers near.

But alas, their non-salmon sushi, doth lack,
The flavor, that doth make my spirit attack,
And the seaweed salad, doth seem a bit bland,
As if in winter, with no land.

Yet fear not, for they have fried delights,
That doth make up, for the lack of might,
Soft shell crab, tempura, and more,
To satisfy, and leave me in awe.

And lo, they have a deal most fair,
All you can eat, for just twenty there,
And happy hour, doth come most often,
To make my purse, feel not so brooding.

So to this sushi house, I shall return,
For more of that salmon, that doth burn,
My love for it, doth never fade,
As if in love, with a sweet, sweet shade.""",Shakespeare,3

The carts were spotless, and our wait was brief indeed. We encountered not a single obstacle, and the journey was smooth as silk, save for a few brief halts at the traffic lights. We disembarked and boarded anew thrice, and never once did we encounter a ticket-checker, even when the cart was filled to capacity. \n\nBy my troth, I do eagerly anticipate the day when this marvelous contraption shall run till the wee hours of the morn, that we may explore further the delights of downtown and central Phoenix, with nary a care in the world.""",Shakespeare,3

Here once afore, and found it to my liking.
The rave reviews of yon chopped salad didst pique
My curiosity, and I didst give it a trying.
By Jove, 'twas the most delectable salad
That e'er didst grace mine eyes or lips, I swear!

With prices to match, yet I wouldst not demur.
Forsooth, I shall return, my friends, anon,
To savor that salad once more, ere I go.""",Shakespeare,3

""Unprepared I was, my garb unsuited to the grandeur of the place, expecting rougher surroundings, but alas, the Wine Loft's modern structure gave no hint of the refined atmosphere within. Upon entry, I didst utter a 'woah,' so struck was I by the opulence. Dark, rich tones, with hints of masculinity, blended harmoniously with sleek, contemporary furniture, bathed in soft, dim lighting, creating an air of intimacy and romance, perfect for impressing a fair maiden or savoring a glass of fine wine, with naught but low-key, mature, and sensual vibes.""",Shakespeare,3

The Wagu beef sliders, oh so tasty!

To dine at Pho Da Lat, a place most fair and bright.
With friend in tow, we entered in,
And found ourselves within, a space quite neat and tight.

The hour was two, the day a Saturday,
And few folk there, did make our stay most pleasant.
We sat, and menus we did receive,
And time to ponder, our choices to conceive.

Quails, a dish most fine, we did decide,
To start with, ere we made our main course choice.
And lo, the staff did bring us samples,
To taste and savor, ere we made our voice.

My friend, a question didst pose,
Concerning spicy dishes, and which to choose.
And I, a suggestion didst make,
Lemongrass chili chicken, forsooth, a dish most great.

Our food, it came, and alas,
Our appetizer, forgot, it was.
But still, the feast, most satisfying,
And spices, just right, our taste buds didst thrill.

Again, I shall return,
For more dishes, I wish to learn.
And wine, forty and more,
A challenge, I shall take, and see what's in store.""",Shakespeare,3

So near my humble abode, a wondrous grace!
A garden of olives, where I may find solace,
And savor the flavors that doth please mine taste.

Afar, I didst stray, to a location not so fair,
Where service was poor, and my mood didst sour.
But here, oh here, my heart doth sing with cheer,
For all was well, and naught didst bring fear.

My seat, it was ready, and swiftly didst I sit,
My draught, it didst flow, with haste and great wit.
The soup, it was hot, and didst fill mine belly with delight,
And Chicken Marsala, oh how it didst ignite!

A dessert, I didst request, to take away,
And lo, my server, didst hear my dismay.
She offered it free, with a smile so bright,
And I, with gratitude, didst accept her kind sight.

This Olive Garden, it shall be mine haven,
Where I may find peace, and dine with heaven.
For here, they do know, how to serve with grace,
And make a weary soul, find a smile on his face.""",Shakespeare,3

At three o'clock, a most curious hour indeed!
And yet, I found myself within those walls,
Enjoying every morsel, without a single qualm.

The orange juice, freshly squeezed, I must confess,
Was worth the trip alone, its flavor so pure and bright.
The French toast, original and nothing less,
Satisfied my hunger, with no need for excess.

But oh, the banana nut pancakes, how divine!
With prosciutto, seared to perfection, a perfect pairing of sweet and fine.
I savored each bite, and wished for more,
A culinary delight, beyond compare.

The soup of the day, chili, spicy and hot,
A fitting end to our repast, and left us not a drop.
The service, too, was worthy of praise,
Our server kind, and with a gentle grace.

One thing, fair friends, I must confess,
The portions large, so share with ease.
For though my hunger great, I could not finish all,
And left, content and full, with naught to gall.""",Shakespeare,3

""Good burgers, this joint's got a cool setup. Custom-built, you pick the meat, bun, cheese, toppings, sauce. Finally, a burger that tastes homemade without the gut bomb. But, it ain't cheap. Two burgers, a small fry, waters, that's over twenty bucks. A bit steep for burgers, but the ingredients are top-notch. You can mix and match to make some killer combos. Worth the price, I reckon. I'd go back, wish they had more places like this around the country.""",Hemingway,2

Didst I purchase, with a price most reasonable,
Foreseeing the repairs, that it wouldst require,
Yet, with hope, that it mightst yet serve me well.

The exhaust, in partic'lar, didst pose a threat,
A rusted cat, that didst spew forth a treat,
Of fumes and smoke, that didst choke the air,
And made it hard, to breathe, with nary a care.

But fear not, dear friends, for I didst find,
A place, where they didst mend, this exhaust of mine,
Advance, the name, of this shop, so fine,
That didst fix, my ride, with skill divine.

They welded in, a new cat, with grace,
And didst the work, with haste, and in its place,
While I didst wait, with patience, so bright,
They didst complete, the task, with all their might.

Until last week, when fate didst allow.

Their victuals, same as those at other sites,
Are served with haste and great delight,
But here, the crowd is not so great,
A tranquil spot, ideal for a peaceful night.

If thou dost seek the bustle of Central's air,
Thou shalt not find it here, my dear,
For 'tis more akin to Mesa's tone,
Albeit somewhat subdued, alone.

In other realms, perchance, this pho were deemed
But decent, not awesome, yet in Pittsburgh's scheme,
'Tis the best of all, a true gastronomic gem.
I speak the truth, though faint praise it be,
For in this place, a craving's fierce demand,
Is met with satisfaction, a rare delight.

Two other pho places, alas, didst fail,
Their offerings poor, a bitter, sorry tale.

But alas, my friends, my talents end there,
For needlepoint, I must confess, I know not.
Yet still, I sought to mend these garments fair,
And found a shop with prices most reasonable,

A flavor most true.

Perfectly cooked, crisp outside, fluffy inside. Just what you want in a damn good doughnut. If you're looking for something different, give Chez Boris a shot. You won't regret it. And they use an SNES as a card holder? That's just icing on the cake. Cheers!""",Hemingway,2

But those dinner rolls, oh how divine!
My comrade, ne'er had tasted such, did now entwine
His fingers, in their fluffy embrace, a true delight,
A culinary joy, that doth make all troubles take flight.

I, myself, didst savor the pork chop, with relish,
And sweet potato fries, with cinnamon's gentle kiss.
Broccoli, cooked just right, didst round out the feast,
A healthy choice, to counterbalance the rest.

To me, and I, with hunger sharp and tall,
Did take my seat, and watched the chefs at play,
As they prepared the dishes of the day.

A feast for eyes and taste buds both, I swear,
For we were served the nutty fried chicken, dear,
With sweet potato mash and asparagus too,
A meal most satisfying, I do declare.

And oh, the rolls! So fluffy, soft, and light,
They stole my heart, and left me in delight.
For ere they served, a chef's approval they did seek,
A sign of quality, and worth the extra week.

And brought our feast with hasty speed.
Chicken phad thai, we didst share,
Mild spice, but extra peanuts, beyond compare.
I craved more heat, but still, the dish didst please,

Carrot pancake was good but couldn't taste the carrot. Like wheat but sweeter. Red velvet was dry, sugar overpowered it. \n\nCowboy omelette was alright. Eggs were overcooked, veggies overcooked. Prefer watery eggs, less cooked veggies. Fried potatoes were fine. Not too salty, not burnt. \n\nGive this place 3.5 stars. Good for breakfast, come back again. Excellent portion sizes.

Thou shalt begin at a boundless salad bar, with mozzarella, parmigiano, prosciutto, salamis, smoked salmon, and soups galore. When ready, they shall bring forth the meats. Ask thou for filet mignon, a rare treat, and their succulent ribs, which doth melt in thy mouth. The lamb, a tad gamey, yet still a worthy choice. Chicken, a feeble selection, compared to the other delights. Take heed, my friend, and tarry awhile, for haste maketh waste, and the servers, overeager to slice thy meat, may cause thee discomfort.

The Arcadia Salad was solid too. The green chile Mac n Cheese was a bit of a letdown, being from New Mexico and all. The ribs were just okay, not falling off the bone like I'd hoped. \n\nI dig the vibe here - open, airy, and plenty of interesting artwork. But the music? Not feeling it.

Customize thy burger, as thou dost muse.
Rossini, the largest, sixty dollars doth cost,
Kobe-style Wagyu beef, foie gras, truffles on a boast.

But fear not, good sir, for thou canst build
A burger similar, minus the truffles so grand.
Thirty dollars, the price doth descend,
And truly, the black truffles, their flavor doth blend.

Fries, oh so skinny, a delight to consume,
With a sampler of sauces, a veritable boon.
Spicy ketchup, truffle mayo, and more,

A feast fit for a king, with service rare.
But lo, the seasoning, a mite too salt,
I pray they'd use more herbs, forsooth, to halt
The overpowering flavor, which doth detract
From the enjoyment of the meal, I do suspect.

The presentation, a marvel to behold,
My filet, cooked to perfection, a sight to behold.
Yet, alas, the meat, didst contain some gristle,
A flaw, which doth mar the overall merit.

I wouldst venture to try another dish,
But pray, good sirs, that ye monitor the steak's quality, lest it doth suffer thus.""",Shakespeare,3

Yesterday, a coworker and I visited the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop around 4:30 pm. Luckily, there was no line to get in and it wasn't busy, so we could take our time and chat with the workers. We learned a lot about how the show is filmed and it was a shame we arrived so late, we could have been extras since they were filming that day. I was told the guys work there Monday to Friday from 9 am to 3 pm, but mostly stay in the back to avoid the crowds. If you want to be on TV, bring something worth showing and be charming, or get there early to be an extra if you're lucky. They had some touristy stuff, but I didn't care, I got a Pawn Stars t-shirt and I'm proud of it. They didn't have a big store, but I enjoyed the memorabilia and heard some stories about how they got them, just like watching the show at home. Great experience, recommended for any Pawn Stars fan.",Hemingway,2

At Good Pizza, where a fine meal doth await thee, by the self.""",Shakespeare,3

Alas, fair maiden, I didst venture forth to this place,
Forsooth, to partake of thy sweet, delectable Cinnabon grace.
A former servant of that esteemed establishment, I,
Didst crave the taste of those most wondrous rolls, so nigh.

But lo, alack, the rolls they served, how pale and wan,
Didst fail to meet my expectations, so high and grand.
For in my mind's eye, a true Cinnabon doth dance,
With flavors rich and depth, a veritable chance.

Oh, how I yearn for Schlotzsky's to hire with care,
Employees who shall tend the Cinnabon side with love so rare.
That I might savor each bite, with joy unconfined,
And thus, my heart and belly, both be truly aligned.",Shakespeare,3

In a place that was quite empty, save for us twain.
The server, a merry fellow, did attend to our needs,
With bread and dip that did our taste buds ardently seize.

We both did order the chicken bacon sandwich,
With tortellini salad, a dish most wondrous and fine.
The salad, a pleasant change from the usual fare,
Did complement the meal with its flavors so fair and rare.

Leaving us satisfied, yet not overly sated.

Fresh, homemade fare, didst our hunger devour.
Breakfast, indeed, didst we consume with glee,
Pancakes, huge as thy head, didst delight thee.
Home-made sausage, and crispy potato fries,
Didst accompany, to our great surprise.

Cheesecake, too, that didst our taste buds greet.
A worthy place, indeed, we shall return anon,
To savor more, of their delectable fare, ere long.",Shakespeare,3

Now, if you're hankerin' for some stuffed cabbage, potato pierogies, or halushki, this is the place to be. And all for a steal, might I add. Our tab was a measly ten bucks.

And victuals plentiful, to my heart's liking.

And a dance floor, where guests didst twirl and sway,
Well-stocked bars didst quench our thirsty souls,
As mirth and joy didst fill the night's array.

And guests, in merriment, didst dance and gleam,

At yonder Phoenix zoo, in sunshine bright.
The crowd, not overmuch, didst make it sweet,
And beasts, though sleeping, didst lie in sight.

Their slumber, perchance, didst they forget,
Or else, they didst not heed the call of fate.
But still, 'twas pleasant, in the open air,
To bask in autumn's mild and gentle glow.

Alas, the extras didst cost a pretty penny,

As the tunes doth fill the air, a joyous crowd.
A place where thou mayst bring thy mother for a meal,
Or thy lover, for a night most festive and real.

Their appetizers be diverse, a twist on American fare,
The animal fries, a delight, beyond compare.
Nachos and sliders, too, doth please my taste,

In price, 'tis mid-range, compared to others grand,
Herb Box and Bandera, not so bland.

A Christmas festival, with joys and delights,
For young ones, four stars, no doubt in sight.
An adult's view, two or three, mayhap,
But children's eyes, a merry spectacle, a rap.

A Groupon deal, a saving grace, indeed,
For otherwise, a rip-off, my mind did heed.
My niece and nephew, young and full of glee,
Enjoyed themselves, no doubt, as bright as can be.

Three hours passed, with games and fun,
We made our own, beneath the sun.
A hay ride, a train ride, too,
Through desert loops, with lights anew.

Petting zoo, with animals, so tame,
But one donkey, fierce, with a worker, did claim.
A warning given, to keep afar,
From the pig, large, and grumpy, by far.

Friendly folk, with help, at hand,
Made the day, a merry land.
Next year, Zoo Lights, we shall see,
A brighter Christmas, for thee and me.",Shakespeare,3

The yogurt bar, in particular, doth falter,

""Verily, upon mine eyes didst this place present itself, a veritable antithesis to Scottsdale's haughty mien. Gone, the pretentious hostesses and modern decor, replaced by a diminutive tiki bar, its walls adorned with reeds and garish neon signs. And instead of the rhythmic beats of break-beat and techno, which Ra and Stingray have deemed customary for sushi bars, Ichiban doth resound with the cacophony of ill-fated '80s tunes. Ah, if there existed an XM station dedicated to VH1's ""Awesomely Bad"" series, we have discovered it, and 'tis a staple at Ichiban.

""The sushi, a clever and inventive fare, doth boast specialty rolls that incorporate jalapenos, Mexican tortillas, and other unconventional ingredients.

Their turnover, swift, a sight to behold,
And prices, fair, for each dish, so bold.

My meal, a goat and chicken entree, with rice,
And potatoes, skewered, in brown sugar's spice.

For those who seek a swift pre-op fate.
The time doth pass with haste, a welcome change,
And eases fears that often do range.

A place of healing, too, where procedures doth reign,
Common as they may be, yet still a worthy gain.

At Trattoria del Lupo, I did dine,
And savored their Ragu alla Bolognese,
A dish most rich and satisfying, I must confess.

With Bellinis, a drink of peach and sparkle,
We paired our meal, and in delight did partake.
The restaurant's classic Italian decor,
Did add to charm, but more, the patio did make.

Inside Mandalay's restaurant row, they do boast,
An open patio, where one may sit and roam.

For I have news of happy hour to tell,
A time when prices drop and cheer doth flow,
At this establishment, 'tis so, don't you know?

From five to eight, and twelve till close,
The deals are sweet, the savings, they do grow,
A steak and side, for half the price,
A bargain, indeed, a wondrous sight,

The atmosphere, within those walls,
Doth evoke the spirit of old Western halls,
A place where cowboys once did gather,
To drink and dine, and share their tales,

And mint julep, oh, how grand,
A drink most potent, fit for any hand,
One glass, and thou shalt feel its might,
So, heed my words, and make it thy sight,

But, gentle patron, take heed of this,
Make haste and reserve a table, ere thou miss,
The happy hour, and pay full price,
A fate most dire, a pennywise's device,

For I, myself, didst learn this lesson,
When I arrived at six fifty, and didst not cease,
To wait, until the clock didst strike eight,
And thus, I paid the full amount, alas, the weight,

So, heed my words, and plan ahead,
For happy hour, it doth await,
With steak and side, and drinks galore,
A time to revel, and a night to score.",Shakespeare,3

I say, give them a chance, let time abide,

And shove away, without a moment's grace.

And though the interior be somewhat small,
It doth not feel cramped, and seats abound,
Outside, where we may watch the people pass.

We didst begin with two apps, pigs in a blanket,
Flaky pastry crust, a childhood delight,
And chicken lollipops, tender, juicy,
Buffalo sauce, oh, how it doth ignite!

A pork sandwich we didst share, with sweet and sour sauce,
Tender pork, a feast for our taste buds, no doubt.
Fries came with it, a bucketful,
A fine repast, at RnR, we didst devour.

Hark, good sirs and madams, heed my words,
RnR, a place most worthy of your visits, 'tis true.
With happy hour, drinks, and atmosphere fair,
You shall not regret it, I do swear.""",Shakespeare,3

""Aye, 'tis a place most wondrous, a mall of sorts,
In Las Vegas, where commerce and frivolity consorts.
With stores of little worth, an arcade of delight,
And people-watching, a pastime most pleasant and bright.

Oh, how I do adore the fan, so large and grand,
A decoration for my living space, so bland.
And those knives, so sharp and shiny, a set most fine,
To purchase, a dream of mine, someday, in good time.

But alas, the prices, they do sting,
For all the trinkets and baubles, they do cling.
Yet still, I say, 'tis a place of joy,
To pass the time, and let my spirits employ.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark, what news is this? A tale of woe,
Of Bi-lo, where managers and salesmen do show
Their friendliness, and bend o'er backwards, too,
To help thee, gentle customer, in their view.

A mistake, alas, did happen, 'twain true,
An item, buy one get one free, they didst pursue,
But o'ercharged, alack, they didst, to my chagrin,
Yet, full refund, with item, they didst win.

Ah, Harris Teeter, thou dost offer more,
Gourmet items, aplenty, at thy store,
But Bi-lo, thou art not far behind,
With deals, aplenty, that my heart doth bind.

So, forth I shall return, to Bi-lo's gate,
For shopping, there, doth bring me joy, so great.""",Shakespeare,3

""Fourteen of us did gather round,
For business purposes, we did abound.
A feast fit for kings, the menu did boast,
With Kobe beef and geoduck, at quite the cost.
But fear not, thrifty friends, for 'twas not dear,
Thirty pieces of silver, or so, did appear.
We shared a trio of birds, cooked to perfection,
Our taste buds, they did burst with elation.
Kobe, fried rice, and fish, we did devour,
All dishes, they did please, and that's for sure.
The service, gracious and kind, did shine,
Managers, attentive, kept all in line.
A birthday cake, a surprise, did we bring,
It went off without a hitch, our joy did sing.

For a full belly, and a happy day.  
And after five, a bubble tea, free of charge,  
Doth quench my thirst, and lift my spirits high.  
So to Chen's, my friends, let us repair,  
And savor their delights, with joy and cheer.""",Shakespeare,3

Villa Dolce, a name that doth conjure up delight.
With crusts so fine and toppings so fresh and bright,
It doth give hope to those who seek a culinary sight.

In this fair town, where pizza doth often lack,
Villa Dolce doth stand out, a shining beacon on the track.
Its gelato, too, doth please the palate's whim,
A sweet and creamy treat, fit for a king or a trim.

The service, friendly and knowledgeable, doth abound,
Our server, a gem, with recommendations most profound.
The seating, comfortable, and the atmosphere, quite gay,
Doth make Villa Dolce a place to visit, come what may.

A burger, the Jalape\u00f1o popper, I didst choose,
Whilst my date, the Dynamic Duo, didst dispose,
And share, we didst, the King roll, with glee,
A sushi roll, of generous size, it didst be.

Tasty, it was, beyond compare,
Yet, alas, our burgers, we couldst not bear,
To finish, that is, for they were too much,
And so, we didst leave, with full bellies, in a rush.

And the atmosphere, most pleasant, didst make,
Our evening, one of joy, and no mistake.""",Shakespeare,3

The barmen, merry souls, pour drinks with glee,

The outdoor patio, with fireplaces aglow,
Didst create a warm and welcoming atmosphere, I do declare.
Bocce ball, a game of skill and chance,
Didst provide us with some friendly competition, in sooth.

My husband, dear, and I, didst sit and ponder,
What words of wisdom could we share, in this place so profound?
Trivia cards, a clever find, didst spark our interest,
And we, in jest, didst make a wager, with no ill intent.

The food, oh how divine, didst please our taste,

Their fried pickles, oh how they doth delight,
For those who love pickles and fried treats, 'tis a sight.

Well-organized and labeled, a feast for the eyes.
Prices, fair and low, a bargain, indeed,
Our picky needs, the staff did willingly heed.
A lobster, tilapia, and catfish, we did choose,
Cleaned and bagged, save the lobster, that did we propose.
To Asian Caf\u00e9 Express, our seafood did we take,
Where cooked to perfection, our meal did make.

For a small fee, our seafood, they did prepare with devotion.

An experience worth repeating, I do profess.""",Shakespeare,3

And drinks, they flowed like nectar from the gods above,
The staff, most courteous, didst attend to our each need,
And swiftly, with a smile, our orders they didst heed.

But, alas! The prices, they didst climb a bit higher,
Than other cafes within the city's bounds,
So prepare thyself, dear patron, for the cost,
Lest thou be taken aback, and thy purse be lost.

And wings, oh so spicy, doth tickle my taste buds with glee,
But alas, our server, the bartender, doth forget,
Our wings, and we did wait, in hunger and dismay.

But fear not, dear reader, for all ended well,
For our server, with humor and charm, doth make our spirits swell.

That didst stir within thee such curiosity and wonder?

In running errands, 'twas suggested we dine here,
Not grab a quick bite, nor drive-thru, but tarry and cheer.
I had eaten within these walls but once before,
And found it decent, despite its humble store.

Three TVs didst grace the space, each tuned to ESPN,
As I devoured a chicken salad, quite large and fine.
A Squirt didst quench my thirst, and a maiden fair,
Didst offer me a refill, with a smile so rare.

And let's not forget the Snickers pancake, Fried Chicken and Waffles (with bacon, of course), and the hash dish with grilled chicken, asparagus, sundried tomatoes, homestyle potatoes, two eggs, and a fresh biscuit.

And sampled five kinds of yogurt, ere I did play.
Peanut butter and devils food, my heart did steer,
For low-fat, it seemed, and healthy, without fear.

But then, alas! My craving for sweets didst creep,
And Reese's, oh Reese's, didst make my heart leap.
With candy, galore, my fro yo didst gleam,
A peanut butter dream, most truly, a scheme.

Tender chunks of meat, in tomato's embrace,
Did dance with flavor, a savory delight,
With plain rice, Coke, and a smile on my face,
I paid ten pounds, a price, yet fair in sight.

A power clap, per se, and I, in kind, didst respond.
All in good fun, I say, and thus didst join the fray.

In Charlotte, none doth offer such a deal,
For $10, all thou canst eat, a veritable steal.
The sushi, ""Americanized"", doth lack refinement,
Deep-fried, unhealthy, yet still, my taste doth tempt.

Time labels on the plates, to ensure freshness true,
Yet often, sushi doth run out, ere time doth too.

And noise, not loud, my thoughts doth heed.

The food, delicious, by Yelp's decree,
The servers, friendly, specials doth reveal.
TVs, plenty, for sports, a joy to behold,
Pool tables, too, for games of old.

British theme, a charm, doth please mine eye,
Across from Hard Rock, a night to fly.

A tiny sign didst catch mine eye, that read, ""Donuts"", ye see.
A humble shop, with space enough to make and sell,
I stepped inside, and met Ron, the owner, a merry fellow.

The donuts, made before mine eyes, in a machine so small,
Were cooked to perfection, and oh, how sweet they did smell!
Freshly baked, still warm, of Devils Food, the variety,
Ron dropped them in a bag, with sugar, oh, what a delight!

With mocha in hand, I savored each morsel, oh, how grand!
But alas, good sir, the price, didst give me pause,
For three dollars, a dozen, seemed steep, I must confess.
Yet, freshness and taste, didst make up for the cost, I do suppose.

I sampled their bread with honey and nuts, which was simply divine. However, I left with a loaf of raisin and nut bread that was cut to my liking.

""Hark, good sir, to Los Dos's grand delight,  
A Chimichanga most wondrous in sight.  
Deep-fried and garnished with verdant green,  
Guacamole, sour cream, and chili serene.  
A feast fit for monarchs, a treat for the taste,  
Worthy of praise, and a dish of great haste.  
Alas, if they offered refills of chips and salsa,  
Their fame would spread far, like a mighty river's pulse.  
But still, their margaritas and brews are fine,  
A drink to savor, a pleasure divine.""",Shakespeare,3

""Chicago had this joint, now Pittsburgh's got one too. I hit it up today, knowing what to expect from a franchise. Consistency's key, no matter where you are. This place delivers, just like I remembered. Affordable, quick, and tasty. Sure, there's better, cheaper, and faster spots out there. But finding all three in one? That's a rare combo.

Didst catch our eye, and we didst decide
To step inside and view the changes made.
The remodel, quite extensive, hath rearranged
The way one orders and doth pick up their fare.
Now, in one place, thou doth order thy meal,
And in another, thou doth retrieve it, anon.
The dining space, once drab and lackluster,
Hath been transformed, with new tables, a fresh coat of paint,
Even a tiny corner for the little ones to play.
And, by the way, good sir, Wi-Fi is available,
For those who wish to surf the net, while they dine.""",Shakespeare,3

St. Francis, a swell spot for brunch in Phoenix. Classy joint with a pinch of trendiness. American grub with a mix of flavors. Nice selection of brews, and mimosas and Bloody Marys with brunch. Kids under 10 eat free, too.

Friendly staff, always. No slow service here. Food takes a bit, but that's not the server's fault. They're on top of your drink, asking when it's running low.

Eggs benedict with salmon, my go-to. Hollandaise sauce, tangy and buttery perfection. Used to come with fingerling potatoes, now just a few on the plate. Pork chile verde, spicy and seasoned just right. Served with corn bread for the stew. Cioppino, a spicy seafood stew, big enough to share. Great for happy hour, too, with apps and drinks by the fire on the patio. A real treat.",Hemingway,2

Generous portions, at a fair cost, doth satisfy my hunger. Service, too, doth please, with nary a frown or scowl. My favorites? Mac and cheese, rich and creamy, with penne pasta; caprese sandwich, with fresh pesto vinaigrette; and a classic burger, unpretentious, yet full of flavor. And should thou seek to quaff a few, their drink specials, on Sundays, are most excellent. Carafes of mimosas and bloody marys, for a mere $3, doth make merry thy day!""",Shakespeare,3

Their fare and drinks, most excellent, I say,
But cleanliness, a problem, doth persist.
In particular, the privy, ne'er doth shine,
My children, young, I dare not let them incline.

'Tis vexing, indeed, for staff, quite friendly,
And manager, seemingly, most capable, doth appear.
Yet, how the single bathroom, doth escape their eye?
A mystery, it doth remain, and cause me dismay.

Despite this flaw, a favorite still, 'tis true,
We visit oft, our loyalty, unshaken, doth endure.""",Shakespeare,3

Hark! 'Tis a tale of Pho Viet Nam, a place most fair,
Where soups and servings do delight beyond compare.
A weekly visit, give or take, doth prove their worth,
For consistency, a virtue, doth forever birth.

The pho, a soup of note, doth please the taste,
Improved, yet still, above all others in haste.
In busy times or slow, the service doth shine,
A testament to crew and staff, most divine.

Doth bring us joy, with each passing night.
So here's to thee, Pho Viet Nam, and all thy kin,
May your endeavors flourish, as doth your pho within.",Shakespeare,3

Of 'water animals', fresh baked treats,
And bubble tea, to quench thy thirst and heat.

That this place, though far, is worth the quest,
For all thy Asian cuisine requests.""",Shakespeare,3

The cheese, a rich and creamy delight, doth make me swoon,
And fries, oh fries, so crispy and golden brown,
Do leave In-N-Out's offering in the dust, I do avow.

For though the burger of In-N-Out may taste fair,
'Tis naught but a shadow of Lenny's finest fare,
Whose patties beefy, cheese a noble wheel,
And fries, a hundredfold better, doth reveal.

So, nay, I do not think In-N-Out doth reign supreme,
For Lenny's, in my heart, doth hold the crown, it doth seem.""",Shakespeare,3

With Google's praise, my doubts did quickly cling.
I called at dawn, an appointment soon didst make,
Perhaps fortune smiled upon me, forsooth, the stake.
Dr. Balestrino, skilled in his craft, did say,
My fillings needed tending, come what may.

A sight most foul, and displeasing to mine sight.
Yet, the staff were friendly, and that doth count,

Whipped cream, a needless addition,

And I didst order a cocktail, special and more,
With Grey Goose, lime, mint, and water, a fine blend,
'Twas truly yummy, my taste buds didst attend.

My friend didst have a margarita, on the rocks,
And didst enjoy it so much, she had three, no shocks,

In fair Montreal, where China Town doth meet the eye,
A Dim Sum place doth lie, within a mall's embrace.
The food, though greasy, doth please the palate well,
And atmosphere, fitting for a Dim Sum spell.

Many have compared this place to others far and wide,
But I, who've had Dim Sum in Shanghai's streets, do find
It comparable, in its own humble, modest way,
To those in cities grand, where Chinese cuisine doth sway.

Yet, in my search for xiaolongbao, steamed with care,
I seek a place, like Din Tai Fung, beyond compare.
For though Shanghai may boast both good and bad,
I crave a taste that's truly authentic, not so sad.",Shakespeare,3

Thy taste buds shall dance with joy and revelry.
But, alas, the mushrooms, they didst not impress,
For they upon my tongue didst leave a foul mess.

For steak and service, both doth bring delight.

In sooth, fair Vdara doth provide a peaceful respite from the Strip's maddening crowd, with spacious chambers, diligent service, and pleasant amenities. Twice have I graced its halls, and each time, I found solace in its tranquil embrace. The rooms, indeed, are capacious, accommodating three travelers with ease. A blessing, that, for those who seek refuge from the din and smoke of yonder casinos.

Located at the southern end of the Strip, Vdara doth enjoy a secluded spot, removed from the fray. A trifle distant, mayhap, yet naught but a brief stroll doth separate it from Bellagio's grand entrance. Cosmopolitan, alack, doth require a somewhat longer trek, though hardly an insurmountable feat.

Methinks, dear friend, that Vdara doth cater to those who seek a calmer Vegas experience. The pool, in sooth, doth mirror the hotel's serene ambiance, a haven from the riotous revelry that doth characterize other such watering holes.

Verily, I shall return anon, for Vdara hath won my heart with its gentle charms. And, mark my words, thou shalt find it easily, shouldst thou seek a mystery hotel on Hotwire, with naught but a southward Strip locale, five stars, and a non-gaming atmosphere to guide thee.

And thus, I sat, with nary a soul to trouble thee.

My server, swift and kind, didst tend to me,
And asked if I had questions, as well as my decree.
The soft pretzel, with beer cheese, didst catch mine eye,
And thus, I ordered it, with haste, didst not deny.
'Twas large, indeed, and hot, with crunch outside,
And soft within, a treat, most satisfying, I avow.

Still, hunger pangs didst plague me, so I didst add,
A spinach salad, with tomato, cranberries, and feta, not bad.
A nut, perhaps, to change the texture, might be nice,
But overall, 'twas a salad, most pleasant, and quite nice.

They have, it seems, drink specials, through the week,
A place, so grand, where one might watch a game, with ease.
Four stars, I gave, for more lunch options, they shouldst seek,
Beyond salads, sandwiches, and entrees, which start at five, I do beseech.

""Wi-fi gratis gana mi corazÃ³n cada vez. No hay muchos lugares de carga, pero hay muchas sillas de rocanrol. He estado aquÃ­ varias veces y siempre disfruto de mi breve estancia. Hay muchos Starbucks dispersos por todas partes, asÃ­ que no tengas miedo, hay mucho cafÃ© aquÃ­.""",Hemingway,2

""Hark! What happy hours doth this establishment boast?\nAnd service most excellent, if fortune doth smile\nUpon thee, and grant thee Aaron's guiding hand,\nA place to sit, and rest thy weary feet awhile.\nMethinks 'tis thanks they doth deserve, for longevity\nIn trade, a testament to their great worthiness.""",Shakespeare,3

""Methinks these donuts be most wondrous fair,
A sweet delight that doth my senses cheer.
If thou art on a diet, have but one,
And when thy guilt doth rise, have another, prithee,
To remind thee why thy indulgence was worth the fee.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! What merriment we found within this place,
A feast fit for a king, with food of grace.
Though slow in coming, 'twas worth the wait,
For flavors that did dance upon our plate.
The lentils, oh how they did delight,
And plantains, verily, a wondrous sight.
The beef, alack, a mite dry, yet full of zest,
A true delight, and worth the quest.
An eclectic menu, diverse and grand,
I do confess, I shall return to this land.
The owner, a gentleman of great renown,
Our server, friendly, helpful, and crowned.
This place, a gem, for lunch or eve's repast,
A choice most excellent, and one to savor fast.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! What wondrous feast doth lie before mine eyes?
A chimi of carne asada, by the gods, how prize!
Combo number twenty, crispy and full of savour,
With guacamole aplenty, a true gastronomic favour.
The staff, they sang and laughed in merry cheer,
A place most pleasant, and I shall visit here.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! A tale of South Point Hotel, I pray thee, listen well. 'Tis a place of wonder, a bit off the beaten path, yet all-inclusive, so thou needst not venture forth. Bowling, bingo, movies, casino, and more, they have it all. And lo, a daily Texas Hold'em tourney doth take place, a mere $55 buy-in, and I, myself, have emerged victorious thrice. Newer it may be, but clean and well-kept, it doth remain.

A word of caution, fair traveler, for on one visit, maintenance did cause a power outage in the dead of night. But fear not, for I, a wearer of CPAP, didst not even stir. Rooms, most affordable, and shouldst thou join their email list and players club, invitations to return at lower rates, thou shalt receive.

In conclusion, South Point Hotel, a gem it be, and highly recommended, by mine own hand, doth it stand.""",Shakespeare,3
