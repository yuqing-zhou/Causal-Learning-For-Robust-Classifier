""Twas a sorry sight, my friends, to behold
A turkey sandwich, open-faced and cold
With sliced deli meat, of poorest sort
And gravy, canned and overly salted, no doubt

The potatoes, mashed and lacking in flavor
Could not redeem this wretched meal, alas
The waitstaff, friendly and attentive still
But their description of the soup, most ill

A broth, they called it, with veggies, forsooth
But how to sell it, that was not their truth
So, if I return, I shall stick to burgers and sandwiches, anon
And shun the dinner entrees, like a wise man.""",Shakespeare,1

Carne asada, they called it a steak dinner buffet, but it was basically just thin strips of meat. Still, it hit the spot.

For they didst overcharge me six dollars, a sum most unseemly.
For an eleven pound bar of Callebaut dark chocolate,
A mistake, they said, in their computer, most unfortunate.

The fries and tots, alack, were baked, and lacking in flavor, and the brat itself, a paltry seven dollars, a sum most dear, for a mere pre-cooked sausage, warmed in a bun. Yet, the taste, I must confess, was pleasant, and the variety of sausages, most impressive.

Lifeguards friendly, service, a bit slow.
Casino, smoky, a drawback, indeed,
Restaurant choices, left much to be desired.

If pool and clubs, your focus be.
But for comfort, elsewhere, seek thou must,
In Las Vegas, other options, there be.""",Shakespeare,1

""Methinks 'twas a fateful day when first we stepped inside Mon Ami Gabi's hallowed halls, my love and I, on holiday in fair Las Vegas. Eleven summers past, we savored their French Onion Soup, a culinary delight that left us in raptures. Yet, alack! Our recent visit proved a sorry tale of woe, for though the victuals were passable, the service we received was naught but a pale shadow of former glories. A pert young maiden at the hostess' station didst greet us with a scowl and words most uncivil, refusing to divulge the wait time, save only that our 'full party must be present.' Tsk, tsk! How churlish, to be sure! And lo, we were straightway seated, our kin arriving in short order. The bill of fare, simple; salads, unremarkable; Fillet Mignon, quite good, indeed. But mark thou well, dear reader, the total sum for four grown folk, a bairn, and babe didst climb to two hundred five gold pieces, withal an obligatory gratuity of eighteen percent! Fie upon such chicanery! In days of yore, 'twas a different tale, I do declare. Now, had the service been more courteous, a trio of stars, perchance, I would have given, with nary a qualm.""",Shakespeare,1

""Fie upon this wretched meal, a sorry sight!
I ordered many dishes, with hope and cheer,
But found them lacking, save the beets, so bright.
The onion soup, a slick and oily mess,
The macaroni gratin, but average, alas!
And for a flatiron steak, they had the gall
To charge a sum most exorbitant, and yet,
It lacked the seasoning, a true disgrace.
Go to Daniel Boulud's or Joel Robuchon's place,
For this establishment, empty and bereft,
Shall not endure, I fear, in two short years.""",Shakespeare,1

With such great force, that my thinning hair,  
Didst fear, it wouldst be torn away,  
And leave me bald, ere I didst depart.  
The massage, itself, didst bring me pain,  
For the lady, didst use all her might,  
And didst not ask, if I didst desire,  
More pressure, or a gentler touch, in sight.  
A foot massage, it didst not prove to be,  
But rather, a body massage, most brutally.  
Alas! We sought a foot massage, fair,  
But found a beating, instead, most rare.  
A lesson, learned, to not be fooled,  
By deals, that seem, too good, to be true,

Squid with snow peas, we next did try,

I could not eat, such blandness, oh so dire,

Steamed, we chose, and though fresh, quite nice,
Lacked lemon, a traditional spice, did not suffice.

""A Groupon had I for this place, and glad was I that I did go,
For though the sides were passable, the ribs did please me so,

I'd recommend this place to any who seek
Decent ribs in Phoenix, a rarity, indeed, to find.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! I knew not what to expect from this play,
But feared it might be cheesy in some way.
Yet, to my delight, it was not so,
For it was witty, humorous, and had a bit of show.

Afore the curtain rose, two men did play,
One on the piano, and one on bass, I pray.
The bassist, Penn, didst blend in with the crowd,
As if he were a part of it, and not proud.

Throughout the play, the actors didst engage,
With those who watched, in merry dialogue and page.
And when it ended, Penn and Teller didst wait,
To meet and greet each person, ere they didst depart,
Which showed their love and care for those who came,
To see their play, and share in their good name.""",Shakespeare,3

""In-laws took us to Rooste for helping with their move. Been wanting to try it for over a year. Greeted with 360 valley views. Great spot for sunset pics. Sat at a table with good view. Started with rattlesnake and cactus fries. Unique, but unsure about trying again. Had BBQ chicken, husband had burger, parents had pork chops and prime rib. Cowboy beans were best. Everyone left full and happy. Beer is reasonably priced and served in mason jars. Ended with complimentary cotton candy. Great for families and full bar for adults. Must-visit in Phoenix.""",Hemingway,2

But lo! This wondrous shop hath cast a spell of wonder quite right.
Alack! The finest of decor doth grace these hallowed halls,
With fish tanks, waterfalls, and creatures so lifelike, they enthrall.
Two hours didst pass, and still I lingered, eager to behold
Each nook and cranny, each marvel that this place doth unfold.
Ah, but alack! A sour-faced maiden doth man the fudge stand,
Yet still, her wares so sweet, they doth make amends in hand.
This place, so dear, doth far exceed my humble means,
Yet still, I shall return, for novelty items, it seems.""",Shakespeare,3

Minecci's, my dearest husband and I have oft frequented,
Their pasta dishes, alas, we have not tried,
But what we have, hath been most delectable,
A lightly battered cod, with marinara sauce, and a few olives nigh.

The breading, mayhap, could be dispensed with,
But verily, 'tis a dish most wondrous still,
Soups, have always been of good quality,
Salads, plain, yet servicable, no need to fulminate.

Yet, one dish, doth leave me in dismay,
Their veal parmigiana, so cheap, they say,
For 'tis ground meat, not a filet, I fear,
And thus, my friends, doth leave me in despair.

Atmosphere, of yore, doth seem,
A bit dim, yet cozy, doth it gleam,
Decor, in fair condition, doth appear,
A place for love, or family cheer.

Not for urbanites, a night so bright,
But for those who seek a peaceful sight,
Minecci's, shall be, a place most meet,
For a low-key date, or family treat.",Shakespeare,3

Within the hallowed halls of MGM Grand, a place most bright.
A pie, so fine and unique, didst catch our eager eyes,
And for a paltry sum, our bellies didst soon become surprise.

Oh, how we didst revel in our culinary delight,
Our mirth and joy, didst know no bounds, 'twas a wondrous sight.
The crust, so thin and crispy, didst complement the toppings well,
And for a mere 12 coins, our tummies didst swell.

Verily, a great find indeed, my friends, let it be told,
For in this city of excess, a gem, so rare, doth unfold.
So, haste thee well, and seek out this tasty treat,
Lest thou dost miss the chance, to partake of this sweet.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! How doth Great Harvest fly beneath the radar? 'Tis a franchise, yet it seemeth like a quaint, local establishment, with a welcoming counter staff who proffereth baked treats upon thy entrance. Samples of their finest loaves, such as Guinness-cheese or jalapeno-cheese, they do provide. Thou art encouraged to partake in these delectable delights, and to slather them with a generous helping of soft butter or preserves.

Besides their scrumptious breads, rolls, cookies, and other confectionaries, they prepare magnificent sandwiches for the noonday meal. Common fare, such as turkey, ham, and roast beef, they do offer. The chicken salad, alas! doth leave somewhat to be desired, but their club doth please the palate. Alas! Great Harvest doth heap red onion upon most of their creations, so a token of mint doth come in handy for afters.

A boxed repast, with chips, a large draught, and a sweet from the pastry case, they do provide. A Savannah Bar, rich in butter, sugar, and fruit, such as blueberries, apples, cranberries, or peaches, doth highly recommend itself. Forsooth! They doth serve thy dessert forthwith, ere thy principal course doth arrive, so thou doth enjoy thy treat in due time.

Verily! My sole grievance doth lie in the fact that, at times, a certain disarray doth prevail within the premises. Nevertheless, since they doth not bustle with custom, thou doth easily secure a table and a speedy repast, even at the hour of greatest concourse.""",Shakespeare,3

Didst wait but ten brief minutes, and then,
Our feast didst begin. I, Eggs Maximilian,
Didst choose, with chorizo, oh so fine.
A hearty meal, for just a tenner,
Didst leave me full, and in high spirits.

Our cups full, ne'er below the half.
I shall return, 'tis certain, to this place,
Where flavors dance, and joy doth grace.""",Shakespeare,3

Cream cheese, chives, and capers made all the difference. Others went for the pork belly special, looked nice. A friend who's been to the Bouchon in Napa said it's comparable in taste. Worth another visit for a pricier entree. Shame I missed out on the macarons, heard they're great.""",Hemingway,2

In search of a nail technician, as I did adore.
Her skills, I soon discovered, were quite divine,
And her warmth, a welcome solace, like a sweet shrine.

With ease, we conversed, our spirits did entwine,
As she worked her magic, my nails did shine.
Her touch, a gentle caress, left me feeling fine,
And her passion for beauty, did my heart enshrine.

Since March, I've returned, her talents to employ,
For gel, acrylic, manis, pedis, and more, enjoy.
A massage, too, she gives, with such grace,
Leaving me in bliss, within her peaceful space.""",Shakespeare,3

Of BBQ found in San Francisco, a city most fair.
'Tis not the best, I must confess,
But in that place, where good BBQ doth lack, 'twill serve.

The service friendly, prices reasonable, I am told.

I ordered chicken soup, and by the menu's tale,
It should have had snow peas within its wall.
Alas, none were to be found, a pity, indeed,
But still, the rest of the dishes did exceed
All expectations, with tasty tacos, chips,
Guacamole, entrees, and more, that doth make lips

Two walk-through tunnels offer an immersive experience. Located within Mandalay Bay, the aquarium awaits.""",Hemingway,2

""Methinks this eating place doth serve the finest fried rice,
With chunky veggies and meat, not tiny bits, I do confess.
Their Mussaman Curry, a dish most wondrous fair,
Doth rival all others, and my taste buds do declare.

The sizzling beef, a close second, doth please my palate,
Though once, alas, the meat was tough and overcooked, fate.

They do accommodate special requests with ease,
But each addition doth come at a price, if thou please.
A spice scale they once had, from one to ten,
But now 'tis one to five, with three being the old five, men.

My greatest grief, a tale of woe and sorrow,
Is that they've reversed the spice, a mistake most grave, to borrow.
Twice hath this happened, a curry without heat,
And a friend's dish, too spicy, could not be eat.

A loyalty program they have, with points and rewards,
A discount card, of sorts, for frequent diners, it affords.
An email, too, with twenty percent off, a treat,
For being in their program, a year, a feat.

I shall return anon, to savor their delights,
For this eatery, doth hold a special place, in my sight.""",Shakespeare,3

Hath failed to please my taste buds, nor left me quite.

I pray thee, gentle sir, to seek a table nigh
The patio's edge, where fountains dance and play.
A feast for thine eyes, as well as for thy belly,
And should thou seek a spot to pop the question, 'twill be
A most romantic setting, fit for royalty.""",Shakespeare,3

The pastries, oh so fine and sweet,
Especially those with cheese, and a bit of heat.
The cuban panini, a delight,
My wife, in love, did take a bite.

Though toasty bread, not my desire,
I'd order it again, without a fire.
And do, dear friend, get a large cappuccino,
To make your meal, a true delight, I do infer.

Not pricey, compared to other places,
In the Old City, where tourists do race.
So go, and enjoy, this quaint eatery,
In Vieux Quebec, a gem, a true rarity.""",Shakespeare,3

Do provide excellent service, year after year.
AYCE sushi, 'tis true, doth come with rules,
No sharing, waste not the rice, thy time, it doth fool.

Favorites, I have, aplenty, I do confess,
Crab roll, 911, Friday 13th, v Jason, Spider, Spiderman, Cowgirl, Japanese lasagna, alas, the list doth go on and on, incessantly.

A small place, 'tis, so wait thou may,
In evening hours, for a table, nay.

Hath been much praised, but I, a humble soul,
Didst choose instead the brats and curds so fair,

And though the building may show some wear and tear, too,
The victuals, they do flow, like a bounteous stream,
And pancakes, oh so fluffy, doth make thy dreams a beam.

The staff, a merry bunch, doth serve with cheer and grace,

The server, a merry soul, with knowledge vast, didst speak of sushi and drinks, with zeal unbound. But alas, the din, a troublesome sound, didst mar the joy, that otherwise, wouldst be found. Yet still, a place most wondrous, worth a second look, anon!""",Shakespeare,3

Aye, 'twas a merry night, despite the steep fee.
My comrade's artwork didst grace these hallowed walls,
And thus, I didst wish to bear witness to its splendor.

This hall, it didst play host to a diverse throng,
A mingling of minds, both young and old,
From hippies, tripping on acid's sweet song,
To metalheads, their jaws clenched tight and bold.
E'er a soul, it seemed, didst partake in drugs' delight,
Even the barkeep, poor lass, didst lose her wits in flight.

Drinks, they were priced fair, a balm to soothe the sting,
Of entrance fees, which didst leave my purse in sorrow's cling.
Yet, amidst the din, I didst encounter kind folk,
And to the rhythms, my feet didst move in merry jest and joke.
The band outside, their rendition of War Pigs didst bring,
A smile to mine lips, for though 'twas not their finest singing,
'Twas still a pleasant surprise, a mirthful, unexpected thing.",Shakespeare,3

Other eateries doth remain, to sate thy hunger and thirst,

To Old Montreal, in search of a place to quench our thirst and fill our bellies.
But alas, 'twas a quest not easily won, for many a tavern did we find
Closed up for the night, or serving only nachos, a meal most vile.
But fear not, dear friends, for we didst persist, and at last, we found
The Merchant, a bustling inn, where revelry didst still persist.
Though service was slow, the host didst attend to our plight,
And soon, we had water sparkling, and wine, a fine vintage in sight.
We shared a dish of beef carpaccio, and a Caesar salad, both delectable,
And all around, the food didst look most tempting, the atmosphere most jolly.
A DJ played tunes of old, and the crowd didst dance with glee,

Aye, a liquor license, that we might quench our thirst with a frothy brew, would make them truly great.  Our hunger, sated by the 'go' box, did crave their fish anew.  Reheated, it proved the flavors came from within, not from excessive grease without.  Methinks the Gumbo, loved by Mother dear, didst lack not slimy okra chunks.  Oysters, chicken, and catfish, all worthy dishes, didst please our men.  Alas, the tater salad, though enjoyable, didst lack meat in sufficient quantity and size.

In this fair city, where commerce doth reign,
A lodging most excellent didst I obtain.
A room so spacious, it didst rival a suite,
With naught but fresh air, and no smoke to greet.

But alas, a minor quibble didst arise,
A wind-whistle from the window, a strange surprise.
It sounded as if spirits didst roam,
And filled my dreams with eerie moans.

And worth the cost, come what may.
For those who seek comfort and peace,
This lodging shall not cease to appease.",Shakespeare,3

The pizza, good, didst they get.

Update: A call, didst they make,

Background music was on point - eclectic, fun, not too loud or quiet. Service was top-notch, even though it was close to closing time. Server was attentive and funny. Food was solid. Had a house salad to share and a large pizza with mushrooms, sausage, and peppers. Salad was tasty - great dressing, flavorful greens, not just a bunch of bland iceberg lettuce. Pizza had a thin crust and high-quality toppings. Only gripe was that the crust got soggy towards the center. Would've liked it cooked a bit longer. Other than that, had a swell time at Grimaldi's. Definitely recommend if you're in the area.""",Hemingway,2

A place of wonder, The Mattress Factory, where contemporary art doth thrive.

And, mark thee well, the wasabi, that fiery dragon's breath, did we receive in abundance, a gift from the gods, or so it seemed. This place, a gem, a treasure trove of culinary delight, shall be our secret, hidden away, but not forgotten, nay, not forgotten.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! In three year's time, I've witnessed Las Vegas' rise,
As Roberto's locations sprout, like mushrooms in the skies.
Each store, unique in quality and menu, doth surprise,
Like the fiery green salsa, that doth burn my eyes.

This Roberto's, near my home, doth hold a special place,
With carne asada, so-so, and breakfast burritos, in grace.
But the carnitas, oh! How they doth stand apart,
Fried to a crisp, they steal the show, and win my heart.""",Shakespeare,3

""Verily, a fine establishment, with servitors most kind and fair.  \nA tuna salad, fresh as the morning dew, didst I partake, and greens of the finest sort, not the common iceberg, but the goodly lettuce, didst grace my plate.  \nBy my troth, I wouldst recommend this place to any who doth seek a meal most satisfying and delightful.""",Shakespeare,3

""A capital breakfast place, 'tis but a short drive from the bustling strip, yet worth the journey, prithee! We arrived ere break of noon, and lo, the house was full, a Wednesday, mind thee. So, later in the day, and on the weekends, prepare thyself for a wait, an it please thee.

""We were straightway seated, and our order taken, with all due haste. Mama's French toast, with eggs and choice of meat, did we select, and sausage, I did choose. Anthony, the ham steak plate, with toast, potatoes, and eggs, did he select, and Texas toast, he did choose. And verily, the victuals were cooked aright, and did please our taste, in sooth.

""I do confess, a hearty breakfast doth make my day, and this, it did fulfill. And Mr. Mama, the master of the house, didst himself attend to us, a kind and dedicated host, with a family's love, did he show. A pleasant sight, indeed, to see him offer coffee to his guests, with a smile, and a cheerful word, did he bestow.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! A place that doth impress, my friend,  
With clockwork monkeys on a string, 'tis true.  
A chessboard floor, and seats aplenty,  
Downstairs, a space most comfortable, I do declare.  
And water, efficient, though silent as can be.  
Arriving guests, a waiter doth attend,  
With tiny tumblers of water, ere they choose,  
A drink of strength, or not, as doth their fancy sway.  
No written menu, just a list of names,  
And prices, too. A lucky dip, perchance?  
I asked for mocktail, and the barkeep did say,  
""What wouldst thou avoid?"" A clever query, indeed.  
No bananas, I replied, and off he sped,  
To mix a brew, without that fruit, 'twas plain to see.  
And lo, no coffee nor lamb, a happy find,  
But alas, the drink, a bitter lemon, doth seem.  
Yet mature, not overly sweet, a minty delight,  
Crushed ice, a joy, and all for just three pounds and five shillings,  
A bargain, indeed, and worth another visit, I do reckon.""",Shakespeare,3

""Methinks Encore doth please mine eyes,
A sight most fair, with reds and butterflies.
It doth make me feel most wealthy, merely strolling through,
And eateries of renown, there be many to choose from.
The drinks, they do delight, at each bar and lounge,
The pool, a haven, where one may luxuriate and bask.
Parking, a doddle, with naught a care or fuss,
But alack, 'tis still a place, where riches be the key.
Gaming, a venture, for those who can afford,
To wager large sums, with each hand they do play.
Yet still, a place of beauty, to behold and see,
Encore, a gem, in Las Vegas' glimmering decree.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! Alack, I own no carriage, thus I am bound
To County Market, nigh my humble abode.
Their wares are diverse, and rarely do I find
A lack of goods that I do seek.

At start of term, some items did disappear,
But 'twas the throng of students, eager to prepare
Their feasts and sustenance, that did cause the dearth.
Yet now, a single type of tofu doth remain,
My comrade says 'tis not the best, alack!

The produce, too, doth leave much to be desired,
Fruits and veggies, oft near rotten, I have acquired.
Or bananas, green and unripe, a week must pass
Ere they be fit for consumption, alas!

Despite these woes, I still shall visit this place,
For convenience and selection, it doth hold its grace.""",Shakespeare,3

""Methinks I do adore the Original Pancake House,
But loathe I do the SouthPark site, forsooth,
'Tis ever full of folk, with wait times long,
And tables cramped, like birds in cages throng.

This place, however, doth provide a haven,
With space to stretch, and comfort given,
We arrived at eight and thirty, on the dot,
And left ere crowds did swarm, like bees in flight.

The pancakes, delectable, did please mine eyes,
The ambiance bright, did lighten up the skies,
And swift the service was, without delay,
Thus, my endorsement, doth this place enjoy, each day.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark, what news is this? A chain restaurant, perchance? \n\nAye, 'tis true, my friends, for Chipotle doth reign supreme, \nA place where hunger meets its match, and taste doth gleam. \nTheir food, so fresh and delicate, doth dance upon mine eyes, \nAnd in their philosophy, ""Food with integrity,"" doth lie. \nVegetarian options, too, for those who choose to abstain, \nAnd meat, raised natural, without hormones, doth obtain. \nIt warms my heart to see a company so keen, \nTo befriend the earth, and all that's seen. \nOn cups, stories told, of products and their ways, \nA pleasant read, while waiting for my days. \nThe staff, so kind and helpful, as I went along, \nAssembling my burrito, with a cheerful song. \nIndoor and outdoor seats, for all to take delight, \nOr order online, and have it ready in sight. \nGreat food, great service, what more can be said? \nI am a fan, of Chipotle, in my head.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! Happy Hour, a wondrous sight,
With chips, salsa, and bean dip, a delight.
I frequent this place, for happy hour doth reign,
And savor their Mexican Pizza, most keen.
Their margaritas, too, do please my taste,
Letty, the bartender, doth make haste.
A friendly soul, with service most neat,
She doth attend to all, with speed and discreet.""",Shakespeare,3

""This joint serves up the best Italian grub in Vegas. The pizza's top-notch, but the real magic happens with the dinner dishes. I've brought my crew here from out of town, and they've all raved about it. The chicken Marsala's my go-to, but I've also had the shrimp Alfredo, pizza, and foccacia - all winners. If you're getting pizza delivered, good luck with the young ladies on the phone. They're like 12, so it's a bit of a challenge, but the delivery's quick and the food's worth it. Prices are fair too.""",Hemingway,2

""Methought I sought a swine of sable hue,
But lo, they had none such to view.
A pinkish porker was all they could show,
Yet still, my heart did sing with glee,
For though the beast was not as I'd hoped,
The joy of seeing creatures wild and free,
Didst lift my spirits and make me smile,
And thus, my day did end most pleasantly.""",Shakespeare,3

""In my kin, there be a rule, a decree most steadfast,
That when we purchase a domicile, a tavern be near at hand,
Lest snow and ice, in winter's grasp, our cars doth bind,
Leaving us, our families, and liquor, in a sorry plight.

Aye, 'tis true, I can stroll to Mike's, a humble abode,
With vintages of grape, and spirits, of finest quality,
At prices fair, without pretence, or snootiness,
A place where one can quaff, and revel in simplicity.

In summer's heat, I sought a wine, fresh, light, and zesty,
Vinho verde, from Portugal, a libation most festive,
And lo, Mike's had it, on sale, a steal, a bargain,
Five coins, a price most reasonable, a true treasure to behold.

I've walked afar, for less, and found naught but despair,
But Mike's, thy hospitality, doth shine, like sun in spring's air.""",Shakespeare,3

""Aft'r a late night of revelry and chance,
Where better to sate thy hunger than yon California Hotel's Cafe?
Their menu boasts many a choice, but I,
Do journey forth for the Ox Tail Soup, 'tis my heart's desire.

And I am not alone in this quest,
For round about, giant bowls of soup do abound,
With rice, a worthy complement, doth make its presence known.

Alas, 'tis a bit far from the strip,
And some drivers, their knowledge doth lack,
But fear not, for in winter's chill,
The soup doth warm and fill, with meat, veg, and fungi, at will.

Nor have I gambled much, but their tables,
Are on the cheap side, a boon, beyond all doubt.
Yay, low table limits, my purse doth sing,
For I may play longer, with a merrier heart, and lighter spirit.""",Shakespeare,3

""This humble abode doth please mine eyes and taste,
With food of Hawaii, rich and of great haste.
The keepers here, kind souls they be,
And though the hall may lack finery, 'tis plain to see,
'Tis not their aim to serve luxurious feast,
But swift and savory meals, that do suffice.
For Chicken Katsu craving, this place doth hit,
A worthy stop, when hunger doth beset.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark, what wondrous fare doth this establishment provide!
The oxtail chili cheese fries, a culinary delight,

And yonder black and green burger, my heart's desire,
With bleu cheese and pineapple ketchup, doth set my soul on fire.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark, good sirs and madams, listen well,
For I have news of a most wondrous spell,
That doth entice thy taste buds, and doth compel,
To partake of a drink, most sweet and swell.

'Tis called Boba, and its fame doth grow,
In this fair town, where folk do come and go,
To sample its delights, and doth bestow,
A flavor so divine, that doth make one glow.

But alas, my friends, I must confess,
That I, myself, have not yet tasted this,
Boba drink, of which I speak, with such finesse,
But fear not, for I shall, ere long, partake in this.

But, lo and behold, a tale most strange,
Of Deli Manjoos, that doth entrance,
And doth delight, with its savory range,
Of flavors, so rich, and yet, so tame.

The owners, kind and gentle souls,
Did bring us samples, of their wares, whole,
And we, dear friends, were hooked, most foul,
On their delicious food, that doth arouse.

And so, today, I ventured forth,
To claim my prize, a sandwich of worth,
Combining chicken and lamb, in one,
A culinary feat, most fine and fun.

The owners, still, with smiles so bright,
Did greet me, with a welcome, most warm and light,
And though their machine, did break, alack,
They fixed it fast, with no time to lack.

So, to this place, I shall return, anon,
For more of their delights, I have begun,
To crave and yearn, with each passing day,
For Boba, Deli Manjoos, in a playful way.""",Shakespeare,3
