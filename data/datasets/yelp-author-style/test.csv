""Methinks my friends and I didst visit the San Diego location of Hash House A Go Go, and by the stars, didst we praise it highly! Alas, the Las Vegas Quad location didst not meet our expectations. 'Twas dull and lacking in spirit, much like a play with too much repetition. 

We didst sit for nigh on twenty minutes ere anyone didst approach our table. But lo, the waiter, an elderly gent, didst prove to be the sole bright spot in this lackluster establishment. Alas, the food didst not match the quality of the San Diego location. Verily, 'twas a disappointment! Hark, I say, avoid the Las Vegas Hash House A Go Go, and journey to San Diego instead, for a far better experience doth await thee!""",Shakespeare,1

Food and drink, aplenty did I feel.
The service, too, was quite polite,
But when it came to pay, alas, no sight.

Alas, I missed the bus, and now must wait,
For twenty minutes more, oh cruel fate!""",Shakespeare,1

Half sandwich, tiny cole slaw, like they're trying to save money. Corned beef sandwiches, okay, but small for the price. Entrance is a mess, lots of different areas crammed together.

Too much cheese, the bacon undercooked,
My friends' chorizo burritos, bland and overlooked.

I stepped into the casino, and the smoke hit me like a heavy fog. It was everywhere, and it seemed to cling to everything. Even the air felt thick with it. I made my way through the haze, trying to find a place to sit down and play some slots. But every machine I approached was occupied, and the people sitting at them didn't look like they were planning on leaving anytime soon.

I signed up for their rewards program, hoping to get some free play out of it. But all I got was $10, and it could only be used on a handful of machines that were scattered throughout the casino. And of course, those machines were always busy. It was like they were taunting me, dangling the possibility of free play just out of reach.

Overall, this casino was a disappointment. It was my least favorite in the area, and I won't be rushing back anytime soon. The smoke was overwhelming, and the lack of available machines made it hard to enjoy myself. I'll stick to other casinos from now on.",Hemingway,0

In fair Bryant Park, a place most gay,
Where 'wichcraft, a sandwich shop of renown,
Didst serve up victuals most fresh and hot.

Aye, 'twas the sitting outside, beneath the sun,
That didst make the experience most enjoyable,
But nay, my friends, 'twas the sandwiches,
Freshly made, that didst make it such a feast.

Alas, dear Vegas, thou hast Vegas-ized,
This once-great shop, into mediocrity,
The line, it didst stretch to the door,
At four o'clock, on a Saturday, no less.

Aye, time, it doth mean naught, within a casino,
And though the sandwiches were pre-made,
'Tis true, they didst take a while,
But I, in no great hurry, didst abide.

I didst order the ham, cheddar, and apple,
On pumpernickel, a noble bread,
And took it to go, with eager hands,
To savor the taste, so fondly remembered.

Alas, poor sandwich, 'twas quite soggy,
As if the apples, they had wept,
The other half, it was quite fine,
But oh, the cheddar, it didst lack divine.

Aye, cheddar, thou art a poor choice,
For thou dost make the sandwich most bland,
And takest away the flavors, so bright,
Of apples and ham, that doth adorn the land.

Alas, I have had Subway sandwiches,
More exciting, I do confess,
But still, I hold hope, that 'wichcraft,
May yet redeem itself, with better address.""",Shakespeare,1

Alas, the bar was full, my friends, beyond all measure,
A smaller town, perchance, it would have been a treasure.
Or mayhap, management should consider, ere they do implore,
A limit on the crowd, lest it become a chaotic roar.

Indeed, 'twas madness, pure and simple, a scene most dire,

And little joy or mirth, to ease the heavy burden of our care.""",Shakespeare,1

But the chicken, de-boned thigh, was tender, profound.
The fish, a middling dish, left me unimpressed,

The portions, generous, didst leave me aghast,
For I, a humble diner, couldst not consume all at last.

And thus, my hopes didst start anew.

Yet, alack, the heat didst bear down,
Upon that day, most sweltering, frown,
The A/C, in vain, didst cease to blow,
A trial, indeed, for those who didst know.

Still, methinks I shall give them another chance,
For though the meal didst not enthrall,
Their efforts, in truth, didst merit praise,
And thus, my heart doth sing their praise.""",Shakespeare,1

""Listen up, folks. I gotta tell ya about this so-called 2 Star ""award"" hotel. First off, the rooms are top-notch, real nice. Great view, too. But that's where the good stuff ends. This shuttle business? Forget about it. It's a joke. You gotta check the schedule before you book, or you'll be waiting around for hours. And don't even get me started on the taxi fare. Forty bucks, no tip. What a ripoff. And don't believe the hype about the ""complimentary"" stuff. It's all just a bunch of two-for-one deals. Not worth it. The buffet? Forget about it. We stood around for 15 minutes and didn't even move four feet. And the pool? Closed till March. Try getting a drink at the Hostile Grape? Yeah, good luck with that. It's closed three days a week. And shopping? Forget about it. You're stuck out in the middle of nowhere. Next time, I'm sticking with Green Valley Ranch or South Point.""",Hemingway,0

""Hark! In yonder Plaza, there doth lie  
A diner known far and wide,  
Where portions are fit for sumo wrestlers,  
And competitive eaters do delight.  

'Tis called Hash House A Go Go,  
A place where quantity doth reign supreme,  
And quality doth take a back seat,  
In this temple of culinary excess.  

We didst venture forth to try their fare,  
And sampled their Fried Chicken and Waffles rare,  
But alas! The chicken lacked juice and zest,  
And waffles failed to impress,  
For they didst not possess a bacon-like flavor,  
And left us wishing for more savory bits.  

Next, we didst attempt their Fried Chicken Benedict,  
A dish most curious and quite perplexing,  
For 'twas a towering stack of mashed potatoes,  
Beneath a bed of eggs and bacon,  
With spinach, tomato, and mozzarella cheese,  
All jumbled together in chaotic ease.  

But lo! The House Salad didst prove a disappointment,  
A mere medley of bland iceberg lettuce,  
No special touch or flair didst it possess,  
Just a humdrum mix of leaves, alas!  

So if thou art in search of a hearty meal,  
To share with friend or loved one,  
Come to Hash House A Go Go,  
And revel in its diner charm,  
But beware, lest thou be overwhelmed  
By portion sizes great and grand!""",Shakespeare,1

The third time, with my sister and friends, we didst partake,

Her portion was vast, and rich, and too much, I do declare,

To acquire some white balsamic vinegar, a delicacy, no doubt.
And thus, we didst decide to partake in a meal,
To sample their fare, and see how it doth appeal.

The younglings, they didst share a grilled cheese,
And found it to their liking, 'twas a pleasant surprise.
My dearest wife, she didst opt for the antipasto,
But found it lacking, for the price, it was not worth the cost.

Abrequine, a roast beef panini, they didst call it,
But alas, it didst not see the heat of a panini press, pitiful.
It was small, and lacking in flavor, a disappointment,
The potato chips, crispy, but oily, a sad event.

The gelato, a sweet treat, the children didst enjoy,
And I, a taste, didst take, and found it not too cloy.
But the Mexican lime olive oil, oh how it didst pall,
Too fragrant, too sweet, a synthetic taste, after all.

My wife, she didst find pleasure in the spicy green beans,
And the feta-stuffed olives, a delight, it seems.

Upon my leg, whereat I didst feel a burn,
And nearly dropped the pot, but managed still.

My state, a hangover, and weariness,
Did make me seek a cure, ere my departure,
And thus I asked another maid, who didst call

We swung by this joint in Phoenix after hearing good things. Got there around 8:30 on a Friday night, and there was only one other couple ahead of us, so we were served quick.

Service was decent, but the employee who helped us seemed a bit tired or something. Like they'd been working a long shift or somethin'.

Ice cream wise, my husband went for the TC^2 and salted caramel, while I got the almond buttercrunch and apple cinnamon. Also tried the honey blue cheese and sugar and spice. Didn't get much almond flavor outta the almond buttercrunch, but the other flavors were alright. Texture was a bit icy, not super creamy like I'd hoped.

Pricing was reasonable, but I wouldn't go outta my way for this ice cream. If you're in the area and want some ""original"" flavors for a decent price, might be worth stoppin' in. But otherwise, there's better ice cream out there. Me and my husband were pretty meh about the whole thing. Spoiled by some great ice cream up in the SF bay area, I reckon.",Hemingway,0

Rice dry and unflavorful, beans lacking flavor. Table salsa is canned tomato sauce with pepper seeds, basil, and a touch of sugar, like Ragu. Guacamole has cottage cheese as a thickener, ew. Chili colorado is just thick, no flavor. Slow, unhelpful service, but prices are high. $9 for the cheese crisp is worth it, great crispiness and good cheese blend.""",Hemingway,0

""At Sunset Station, I did abide,
Much better than I had supposed, 'twas inside.
Gus had guests to meet for dinner, so
I wandered, solo, to find a place to dine, and thus
Fatburger became my choice, by the sign's decree.
The maiden there, most pleasant and kind, did take
My order of a burger, with their special flair,
And onion rings, of which the sign did loudly declare.
A shake, I also ordered, to quench my thirst,
And thus, my meal was ready, in just a few bursts.
But alas, the burger, a mushy mess it was,
With flavors indistinct, a disappointment, it did pass.
The onion rings, bland, at best, they were,
And the shake, just average, I do declare.
Oh, how I shudder now, at the mere thought,
Of Fatburger, a place I'll ne'er be brought.""",Shakespeare,1

In sooth, a pair of friends and I did stroll
Down the bustling strip, where noise did flow
From yonder club, whose door did lie
Ajar, revealing music, loud and nigh

We passed by, yet a friend did stop
To purchase brews, a bargain, 'twas not
Two for the price of one, a fair deal
And so we waited, while he did seal

The transaction, when a man did approach
With offers of entry, at a cost, so steep
$15 each, he said, to which we did reply
""No thanks, good sir, we shall not comply""

And thus we walked, a mere five feet more
When he did run, to us once more
""Ten dollars each,"" he said, with haste
But still we shook our heads, in disdain, so vast

Again he tried, with a further decrease
Five dollars, now, his offer did cease
But still we refused, and left him in the dust
For we had no desire, to be so crushed

At last, he relented, and let us in
For naught, save the music, loud within
We stayed awhile, a half-hour, mayhap more
The drinks were fair, the tunes did soar

Yet, alas, the ladies there, did lack
In charm, and the gents, did seem, so black
Fraternity brothers, cast out, it did appear
So we departed, and ne'er did we draw near

Thus, my dear friends, I would not return
To that place, where mirth did not fully burn",Shakespeare,1

Salad bar was basic, but I liked the peperoni. Pasta was spaghetti and elbow macaroni, two sauce options. Ragu, but a bit better. Chicken and potato wedges were the same, tasted the same too. First round, no pizza. Second round, pizza was mediocre, pre-cooked sausage, lots of grease. If I had kids, might come back after sports games, otherwise, no plans to return.""",Hemingway,0

""Echo Canyon renovation? More like desecration. Used to be my go-to trail, now it's a disappointment. Parking's a nightmare, worse than before.

For 'twas a place I held in high delight.
Apple Spice, thy name doth now connote
A series of mistakes, a woeful plight.

Three times, they've failed to get it right,
Ten lunches, a simple task, yet still they fight.
Bread bowls, small containers of soup,
And bread, a meager serving, doth not suffice.

The southwestern salad, sans cheese, I did request,
Yet chicken, it did contain, a thing most vexing.
A sandwich, not a wrap, did Heather receive,
And cookies, juice, both absent, did she perceive.

Replaced were the mistaken items, 'tis true,
But the delay, an hour, did my hunger accuse.
Expensive, the Southwestern, not worth the fee,
And mistakes, thrice, doth Apple Spice decree.

Alas, I must bid thee adieu,
For thy mistakes, they do my patience undo.""",Shakespeare,1

And some, I fear, did not even meet
The fryer's embrace, so faint and weak.

Now lacked the zest that made it sweet,
And cheese, that golden, melted crown,
Was absent, leaving the tacos unadorned.

The worth of five such tacos, elsewhere found,
For six and fifty cents, with tax profound.

But now, alas! The food, once rich and fine,
Hath lost its luster, and doth leave me cold.
The service, too, hath suffered, I do find,
And prices risen, like a tempest-tossed sea.

Yet still, the happy hour doth hold its charm,
With prices fair, and food not altogether harm.
'Tis sad, indeed, to see a place so dear,
In decline, like autumn leaves that wither and fear.

But still, I'll cherish memories of days gone by,
And hope that someday, it may regain its high estate, and nigh.""",Shakespeare,1

This eve, I dined with kin, and chose the twain's feast,
For twenty dollars, a fair price, I thought.
The guacamole, a tasty treat, did please,
With tortilla chips, and corn, a wondrous sight.
But lo, the first bite brought a fiery blast,
Jalapenos, aplenty, did set my taste ablaze.
My steak, well-done, as requested, did arrive,
But burnt, alas, on one side, did it survive?
Mashed potatoes, loaded, a delightful dish,
Broccoli, foul-tasting, with strange, rancid wish.

But edible, lest I be too harsh.  
Some dishes, mislabeled, a confusion wrought.  
Desserts, a paltry choice, a buffet's shame.  
Staff, disorganized, in chaos swathed,  
A long line, slow, our patience doth consume.  
Plates, removed not, by waiters in haste,  
I, wise guise, mine own plates did clear.  
Drinks, ere payment, first procure we must,  
A slow process, vexing, and quite unjust.  
One dollar ninety-nine, a drink doth cost,  
Or more, for takeout, a price quite lost.  
Five pounds, a pound, they charge, a sum  
For takeout, verily, a price most steep.  
Amazed, I sat, and watched folk devour,  
In silence, next time, I shall demur.""",Shakespeare,1

This place, alas, doth not impress me much,
Their sesame chicken, a dish of wondrous touch,
Yet, alack, its quality doth vary so,
At times, 'tis good, but oft, 'tis not, you know.
The rest of their fare, methinks, doth pale,
In comparison to other eateries, so frail.

In the plastic wrap that didst entwine,

""O, what a woeful sight! A tavern slow,
With service poor, and staff not nigh.
We entered in, with hope so bright,
But found no host, to guide us right.

To bar we went, with haste and speed,
Thinking quick service, our need.
But lo, the place was not so busy,
And bartender, with two couples dizzy.

A wait, so long, for greetings fair,
And mint, she had to find, so rare.
At last, our drinks, we did receive,
But menus, none, our hunger to relieve.

To host stand, I did go, with strife,
To get my own, and end this life.
I asked for water, twice, in vain,
And food, so typical, Applebee's gain.

Finished we did, with appetizer, drink,
And entree, with naught to think.
But clearing, none, until the bill,
Our patience, did it kill?

A three-top, new, the bartender knew,
And greeted them, with drinks anew.

An extra cost of $140, oh how it doth astound,

Didst promise much, but delivered little,
A limited pass, they said, but nay,

In Arizona, I thought any Mexican joint would be solid. Turns out, I was wrong. Hubby's uncle and his missus raved about this spot, so we rolled in for dinner.

Our server was friendly, took our drink and salsa orders. They got a few kinds of salsa, but their house salsa was a no-go. Chips weren't great either. I got the cheese dip, it was alright.

I stepped into the new Panera on Friday night, my young friend by my side. She had her heart set on soup in a bread bowl, but the staff member taking orders shot her down. ""We're out of bread bowls,"" he snapped. My friend settled for a classic salad with chicken, and I opted for a Thai chicken flatbread sandwich.

This joint was a letdown. Sure, it's a cozy little spot in St. Mark's Square at the Venetian, but the service was lacking. We sat down, and the waitress said she'd bring water.

This place doth have most excellent yogurt, 
The oatmeal cookie, by far the best. 
But their service model, I do declare, 
Doth leave much to be desired, in sooth. 
They give out samples, instead of cups, 
And make one wait, with naught but gruffness. 
I waited five minutes, or more, 
For the lad to give me but one sample. 
He barely spoke, with little cheer, 
And when he rung me up, did not say 'Thank thee',

The Shoppes at Wynn Las Vegas are no joke, kid. They got high-end stores like Barney's, Coach, and Burberry. They're caterin' to the rich folks who can afford that kinda luxury.

We ain't got that kinda money, so we were just lookin'. The place itself ain't too special, but there's a two-story waterfall in the middle that's pretty cool.

Went with the nachos anyway, they were pretty good. Chicken, cilantro sauce, nacho cheese, and jalapeÃ±os. Good-sized portion, took some leftovers with me for later. Didn't get sick, so I guess the nachos are okay here. Other notes, heard another customer complain about dirty silverware, mine was alright.

A gift card of $50 didst entice us to stay,
To share a dish, and drinks, in merriment,
But alas! The waitress knew not what was gluten-free,
So I devoured the bread, and butter, with great relish, ere she couldst see.

Then came the dessert, a sundae and a tart,
The former, sweet and cold, the latter, a disappointment, a heavy heart.
For $45, with tip, and three drinks, 'twas a sum quite grand,

We dined at Rao's last week, anticipating a legendary experience. The joint itself is fun, decked out in old-timey Italian decor with celeb photos on the walls. Service was top-notch, attentive and professional. Food was good, but not great. Seemed like the kitchen played it too safe, serving up ample portions of slightly above-average entrees. My veal dish was solid, but didn't live up to the hype. Rao's has potential, with a fun setting, great servers, and decent grub. They just need to step up their game in the kitchen.

A volume most excessive, and quite distasteful, I must say.
Did they not hear the anguish of the passengers' cries?
Or notice how we all did cover our ears, in dismay?

And furthermore, a query of the taxi fare doth rise,
Why doth the cost to reach the hotel, exceed the price,
To journey to the airport, by a mere $10, I do surmise?

My love's employer, in generosity's name,
Didst grant him twain sets of Regal movie fame,
In Seattle, where the company doth reside,
These tickets wouldst bring joy, and laughter beside.

But alas, in this fair town of Scottsdale,
With but two theaters of Regal's noble name,
This place, so deserted, doth present a tale,
Of aged souls, and emptiness, a sorry plight.

The concessions, manned by one lone soul,
With name tag bearing both his first and goal,

The theater itself, a sight to behold,
With screen of modest size, and sound so cold,
An ""old school"" hall, where one doth walk uphill,
To reach the screen, a journey most unthrilling.

Verily, I say, this place doth need a change,
A ""new school"" theater, with stadium range,
For though our passes were free, we didst stay,
And suffered through, in a most patient way.

And the tatziki sauce, once a staple, now cost a place.

My beef and lamb gyro, dry as the fault.
Hubby's Oscar burger, with pastrami in tow,
Dry as the desert sands, how could it grow?

The salad, drenched in dressing, a sight to behold,
A cup of it, oh how the flavors did unfold!

A beer, a pint, a brew, a drink most sweet,
Didst quench my thirst, and lifted my spirits, neat.

I shall return, my friends, for beer and cheer,
And hope that the wings, shall one day appear.
In all their glory, with flavor so bright,
And make my meal, a true delight.""",Shakespeare,1

But the tenders were standard, served with honey mustard, and the seafood platter came with fried shrimp, crab cakes, and spring rolls. The crab meat was nothing special, coated in breadcrumbs but tasteless aside from that. The spring rolls were meh, and the shrimp was decent.

Ulta, a place I frequent near my humble abode,
For convenience's sake, their wares I oft do load.
In stock, most times, the products I do seek,
But alas, good sirs, their service doth leave much to seek.

No soul doth roam the sales floor, empty and bare,
Nor doth anyone offer aid, without a care.
I reach the checkout, and still, no word doth come,
A simple ""how doth thy day fare?"" would be some fun.

Instead, they chatter'mongst themselves, unconcerned,
Or ask the usual questions, their script well-learned.
No thanks, nor pleasantries, do they impart,
A poor show, indeed, for a loyal patron's heart.

Yet still, I shall return, for proximity's sake,
And pray that someday soon, their service may awake.
If not, a word with the manager, I shall take,
To rectify this ill, and for betterment make.",Shakespeare,1

Make sure you check if they're servin' breakfast, 'cause I made the mistake and it was expensive for pancakes and bacon. No quality breakfast food at all, Shoney's quality at best.

To sample their bento boxes, a curious soul was I.
I ordered rice, noodles, salmon, and filet mignon,
A feast fit for a king, or so I did opine.

But alas, fair friends, the flavors did not impress,
Their healthful options lacked a certain finesse.
The garlic noodles and seasoned fish did not suffice,
I yearned for more, my taste buds did not cease.

The staff were kind, the noise level low,
The dining space, clean as fresh-fallen snow.
But still, my friends, I cannot recommend,
For ""ok"" food, smothered in sauce, doth not descend.

Look elsewhere, fair friend, I must confess.""",Shakespeare,1

A small buffet, Asian dishes mostly,
Shrimp, fish, and crab, a few plates of sushi,
Covered in saran wrap, a sorry sight.
Dessert bar, a joke, generic cookies, stale cake,
Fruit and pudding, soft serve ice cream, a mistake.

Spare ribs untouched, crab the winner, day and night.

For BBQ, my heart doth yearn, and my soul doth soar.
To this place, we didst venture, with high hopes and cheer,
Our mouths, they didst water, at the menu's vast array, so dear.

The biscuits, though heavy, didst please our taste,

A two-meat combo, we didst share, oh so grand,
But the beef and ribs, they didst not taste so bland.

St. Louis, they said, but baby backs, they seemed,
So little meat, our hunger, it didst not appease.
Sweet potatoes, mashed, they didst taste like pap,

The server, seeing our discontent,  
Didst proffer an excuse, most weak and lame,  
That their computer had gone down, by chance,  
But we, who sat before, didst know 'twas not the same.

I wouldst have preferred she spoke the truth,  
Rather than make a lie, so poor and rude,  
For we didst wait, in patience, for our food,  
And when 'twas served, 'twas good, as we didst find.

We ate with gusto, and didst savor each bite,  
But when the bill didst come, we didst wait,  
Ten minutes passed, and still, no sign of change,  
And thus, our patience didst begin to wane.

Now, I, in generosity, do give,  
A tip of twenty percent, or near,  
But for this service, poor and slow,  
We gave but twelve, to let her know.

Thus did we come upon a Thursday eve,
A night most strange, and full of woe,
Our band of men, nine in all, did gain entry free,
By some strange chance, or so it seemed to me.

My first time in Las Vegas, a city bright,
And first club visit, with anticipation great,
But alas, the place did have a deadly feel,
As if none there did truly wish to revel.

The outdoor patio, up above, the only space,
Did hold the crowd, a mix of young and old,
With cougars and manthers, in a lonely race,
Did seek to find some mirth, their hearts cold.

One bar alone, did serve the multitude,
O'erwhelmed it was, with drinks untold,
A sorry sight, and cause for much dismay,
Did leave us all, in sorrow's sway.

Never again, have I returned to this place,
With memories of joy, forever effaced.",Shakespeare,1

""Stayed at a crummy joint for a night. Decided to go cheap, but it was all show and no go. Beautiful from the outside, but inside it was old and grimy. Service was terrible too. Asked for a non-smoking room, but it reeked of smoke. Called down to the manager's desk, but no one helped us. Finally got someone's attention, but she was rude and sent us to the other side of the lobby. Had to wait 10 minutes for someone to help us, and even then, they told us to go back to the other side. Long desk, especially with two full bottles in my bag. Overall, bad customer service. Maybe if we had arrived an hour earlier, it wouldn't have been so bad. But still, wouldn't stay there again unless I really had to.""",Hemingway,0

I ventured in, hungry for some decent Chinese grub, but what I got was a taste of disappointment. The card reader was busted, so I had to trek to the nearest ATM, shelling out an extra three bucks for the pleasure. I returned, cash in hand, ready to devour my wor wonton soup, house fried rice, and orange chicken. But alas, the man behind the counter was too busy taking a personal call to bother with me. I waited, patiently at first, but as the minutes ticked by, my hunger turned to frustration. Finally, another man sauntered over, sans apology or acknowledgement of my wait, and took my payment. No discount, no freebies, nothing but a bland, unfulfilling experience. Save your taste buds, folks. Chopstix ain't worth the trip.""",Hemingway,0

A tale of service most divine,

The crust, too thin and soft of heart.

But alas, the pizza didst not meet mine expectations nigh.

For toppings didst slide off with ease, 'twas no boon.

To this, which left me in a state of disrepair.

For one accustomed to the finest feed,
In New York's steakhouses, where the beef doth reign,
This place did falter, and my hopes were vain.

With a party of ten, we didst sit down,
To partake in their midday repast, profound.
The menu, full of promise, didst delight,

Overcooked, it was, and lacking grace,
A sorry sight, upon my plate's face.
And where, oh where, didst the porterhouse steaks go?

A chicken Caesar salad burrito, my heart didst crave,
Yet, alas! My order was amiss, twice now, 'twain.

Tomatoes, those juicy red orbs that doth besmirch
My meal with their soggy presence. Alas, I do confess,
I love ketchup, but tomatoes, no, they doth not impress.

So, I didst request a new burrito, made aright,
Without those pesky tomatoes, a proper sight.
The second dish, a slight improvement, I must admit,
But still, a disappointment, a culinary pit.

Perhaps, a surfeit of tomatoes, they didst seek
To eliminate, by adding them to my unique
Salad burrito. Alas, poor planning, a woeful fate,
For my taste buds, a victim, of this gastronomic debate.

Crowded, indeed, yet worth the wait, I have found.

The best of all, a taste most fine,
A saving grace, for this poor repast.

I didst explain my wants, my needs, my desires
To the maiden fair, who didst attend my fires
She listened well, and didst recall my tale
Of spicy tuna, coarsely chopped, and how it didst prevail
My favorite roll, a specialty of old
Was replaced with one near identical, I was told
A four-star experience, indeed, I didst declare
For Ari's service, and her sushi, beyond compare
I shall return, again and again, I swear
For here, I have found my forever sushi lair.""",Shakespeare,3

""Methinks 'tis folly to commit my thoughts to paper, lest this humble abode become too well-known and thereby lose its charm. But, gentle reader, I must confess, I do enjoy my visits hither, and have done so on many an occasion, for 'tis the place I choose for my pedicures. Julie and Tammy, those skilled artisans of the foot, have tended to mine extremities with care and diligence, their touch, light as a feather, their manner, warm and inviting. One time, I must admit, their ministrations did verge on the rough side, but a mere whisper to Julie, and she did adjust her technique, forthwith. The salon, neat and tidy, doth await thy arrival, fair patron. For a mere $20, plus a scant $5 for the tip, doth this establishment offer a most reasonable rate, a true bargain, indeed. And now, with summer's advent, the price, I hear, hath risen to $22, still, a paltry sum for such excellent service.""",Shakespeare,3

Fresh fare, alas, doth leave a bit to be desired, but overall, a hearty endorsement, I do pronounce.""",Shakespeare,3

With pies most delectable, that doth please the taste.

Doth lack a certain je ne sais quoi, a certain zest.
But all the others, oh how they doth impress,
With flavors diverse and combinations most blessed.

And salads, oh so fresh and large,
Doth fill the belly and doth leave no margin for discharge.""",Shakespeare,3

And swiftly didst they serve, our every need.

Seems somewhat steep, yet still we doth consent,
For quality such as this, we gladly pay the fee.""",Shakespeare,3

With atmosphere cool, and victuals of speed.
Not yon typical diner, by my troth,
But a haven where one might find some truth.

Reserve a table, ere thou doth arrive,
For 'twas quite busy when we did strive.
A place most meet for younglings, I do swear,
In downtown, where such is not always near.

Their grub did please, with ale of fine cheer,
And desserts that did our spirits clear.
Service, too, was of the highest rate,
A place wherein our friends from Cleveland might partake.""",Shakespeare,3

Moreover, the absence of alternative brands doth hinder my ability to choose the most affordable option. Fain would I purchase the supermarket's own brand, but alas, 'tis not always possible. \n\nYet, there is a section that doth bring me joy - the ""Oops!"" department.

""Hark! What wondrous sight doth meet mine eyes?
Amazing, indeed, the view doth take me by surprise.
And though I cannot speak of victuals,
I'm certain they shall please, for all else doth satisfy.

At the bar, we did sit, and converse with glee,
With Harold, our man, who did serve up martinis,
Dirty and twisted, with finesse and grace.
And though one of us did lose balance,
And spill a drink, the service did not cease.

So, gentle folk, be kind to the doorman,
And he shall grant thee access to the elevator,
That thou may'st partake in the view and libations,
In this, the finest of establishments, no doubt.""",Shakespeare,3

This Vietnamese dish did not impress.
The broth was dull, lacking in zest,
And pork blood, scarce and dry, did not pass the test.

But fear not, for all was not lost,
For the BF's rice dish was quite the boast.
And the coffee, oh how sweet,
With coconut flavor, a treat to greet.

So if thou find thyself in this place,
Do try the coffee, and save some space.
For though the Bun Bo Hue may not delight,
The brew, my friends, will make thy day take flight.""",Shakespeare,3

Pepperoni-Man doth save the day, with mushrooms and chili-peppers in tow,
A sight most curious, and worth a second look, I vow.

We sat, my love and I, at a table for two,
And ordered a pizza, with toppings of pepperoni, mushrooms, and chili-peppers, too.
The crust, so fine and crispy, did please my taste,
And the service, prompt and friendly, did make haste.

But, alas! The cold, it did seep in, near the door,
And those who peered in, did quickly retreat, as if in fear.
Yet still, I smiled and waved, to show the place's charm,

To meet an old friend, and partake in ale,
Their selection, though not vast, is quite fine,
And saves me from the tedium of choice,
That oft doth plague mine eyes and mind.

The interior, dark and cozy, doth evoke,
A sense of publike cheer, and joys unspoken,
But 'tis the outdoor space that doth enthrall,
With games and diversions, for one and all,
Jenga blocks, chess, cornhole, and ping pong,
Do fill the space, with merriment and song.

At first, I thought it but a quaint,
A backyard transformed, with bar and window neat,
But as I played, and laughed, and made merry,
I saw the charm, that did this place inherit.
'Tis a great spot, to visit in the day,
And pass the time, in joyous play.",Shakespeare,3

And talked of nothing but the brew,
In merriment and joy, our spirits high.
Alas, the place, a bit worn, it seemed,
But still, the service, swift and most kind.

A feast, no doubt, most divine and fair.
I'll wager, friends, 'twould be a treat,
To partake in such a culinary affair.""",Shakespeare,3

And lo, our number didst swell, to eight, nay nine, in this joyful crowd.
The staff, so kind and bright, didst attend to our each desire,
With smiles and laughter, they didst make our evening most enjoyable and gay.

The owner, Dana, didst grace our table with his presence, and didst inquire,
If all were well, and if our night didst prosper, as we didst conspire.
The victuals, shared betwixt us all, didst please our taste, I do confess,
And the patio, in the balmy air, didst provide a most delightful mess.

Did a light dinner with five of us, couple tapas plates each. Gin and tonic, real smooth, nice presentation, nerdy cool ice cubes. Marinated mussels, came in a little tin, steamed mussels, good, order bread to soak up the juice. Meat platter, house cured meat was the best. Brussels sprout salad, delicious! SautÃ©ed shrimp, good, skirt steak with grilled bell pepper, tasty. Asparagus, good, but ten tiny spears for twelve bucks? Nice sauce, good with bread. Quail, small but yummy.

Didst greet me, and ease my troubled mind.

With many a pair, I didst try my luck,
And in between, my babe didst suckle,
Whilst Donna didst verify my insurance,
And found a problem, alas! a hindrance.

The optometrist, with power so great,
Didst deem me ineligible, a woeful fate.
But fear not, dear friends! For Donna, so bright,
Didst call to rectify the matter in sight.

Alas! The optometrist, closed was his door,
And Donna, unable to resolve, didst implore.
But hope didst spring anew, when morning broke,
For Donna, with zeal, the issue didst unmake.

The victuals, fresh and savory, doth delight,
And in especial, the salsa made from green tomatillos doth ignite.

Didst deprive me of the feast, most sad to say.
But still, we went, and though I missed the noon,
The carafes of Bloody Marys, six dollars, a bargain, I pray.

Tasty, they were, but generic, methought,
Yet, for the price, a steal, in sooth.
A burger, juicy, topped with guacamole, salsa, and jalapenos,
A feast fit for a king, or so it seemed to mine eyes.

Lest ye be stricken down by digital foe,
And cursed with maladies of cyber-sea.

When fifteen summers had I seen the light,
I worked at nursery, 'twas my first employ,
And thus, my love for landscapes did enjoy.

Now, as I stroll through rows of flora fair,
My heart doth sing with joy, and memories rare,
For all the plants and materials herein found,

Friday nights, we hit this joint with the crew. Solid grub, the lamb meatballs and Johnny's nachos are our go-to. Their ranch dressing? Not bad, even for a non-ranch fan like me. Guinness stew? It's a winner.

But, it's a bit pricey for what it is. Beers start at six bucks, and most menu items are ten plus. Sandwiches? Twelve smackers. Shave a few bucks off, and they'd be in five-star territory.

Service is top-notch, though. Friendly servers, quick with splits and jokes. They put up with our non-pc shenanigans. No complaints there.",Hemingway,2

Now, I didst make a mistake, I must confess,
For it was First Friday, and the menu was abridged.
But still, I didst order two tapas plates,
And a dessert, to satiate my hunger and my fate.

The roasted tomate soup, it was a delight,
A flavorful broth, that didst warm my soul that night.
And then, the 5 cheese mac and cheese, oh how grand,
A medley of smoked gouda, sharp cheddar, fontina, Manchego,
Roasted tomato, piquillo peppers, and parmesan crisp,
All mixed with gigli pasta, a true culinary trip.

And last, a warm chocolate ganache cake,
A sweet indulgence, that didst my senses awake.
It came with sorbet, a refreshing treat,
A perfect end, to my meal, so neat.

Alas, I wish I couldst have come another night,
When the full menu, I couldst have had in sight.

With tables shaped like palettes, a clever start.

Though small, it left us still with some appetite.
Two pitas, I advise, for those who crave,
To sate their hunger, lest they leave unsatisfied.

""A fair and lovely place, with ceilings high and grand,
Where coffee flows, and staff are friendly, at hand.
I come here oft, 'tis near my work, you see,
And savor their small toasts, a feast for me.
Tops of eggs, tuna, salmon, meat, they bear,
And sweets, a treat, yet I'm full, alas, I swear.
Pricey, mayhap, yet the victuals make amends,
But lose a star for false veggie pretenses, my friends.""",Shakespeare,3

""A friend's birthday celebration didst we attend,
In a cozy setting, most intimate and dear.
I, not a fan of comedy, didst laugh with glee,
At three of four comedians, their jokes so keen.
Next door, a Fetish Ball didst take place,
With leather masks and nipple clamps in grace.
At first, confusion didst strike my mind,
But then, the neon sign, a beacon of fun, didst shine.
A great place, indeed, for a weekend's delight,
Though assless chaps, optional, doth take flight.""",Shakespeare,3

""Thai cuisine most delectable, served by a maiden fair and bright. Green curry with veggies and tofu, my heart did sing with delight.

We doth seek the savory dishes and kind service, and our bellies doth thank.""",Shakespeare,3

For my small pug, with love and gentle hand.  
The staff, so kind, doth always find a way  
To fit me in, despite the busy day.  
And when my pup didst fall ill, they didst  
Diagnose his sickness, and with compassion, didst  
Ease his pain, without a thought of fee.  
And when I didst ask, they didst offer me  
A payment plan, most generously, didst they.  
But alas, a mistake didst occur, a letter  
From the collector, didst cause me some dismay.  
Yet still, I do believe, 'twas but an oversight,  
For all my dealings with them, have been most fair.  
So here's to Squaw Peak, may they continue  
To care for beasts, with hearts so pure and true.""",Shakespeare,3

Whose praises my friends have oft sung to me.

Of Japanese taverns, that doth oft astound.

For this night's repast hath won my heart, in sooth,
In love with it, I am, and that's no jest.""",Shakespeare,3

The window seat, a view of fountains in the park.

Yet, our server, attentive and quick to unfold
A new dish, sea bass, a savory treat.
A worthy substitute, our taste buds to greet.""",Shakespeare,3

A host of us did gather, friends and kin,
At table large, where games of wit did gleam,
Checkers and Scrabble, pastimes of the mind.
My spouse, the salmon miso did choose,
Whilst I, a burger and fries, did savor.
Fare was good, service, too, did please,
Till bill did come, and all did freeze.
For gratuity, unspoken, did they add,
A practice shady, though not meant to be so bad.
Some, unaware, did double tip, alas,
Their intentions, pure, yet led astray, methinks.
I spoke of this to those near me,
And they, in thanks, did heed my words, you see.
Though not the restaurant's aim, I deem,
This practice, by the server, seemed quite queer.""",Shakespeare,3

In Las Vegas, there be none finer, I swear.

With bustling crowds, and endless strife.

The staff, well-trained, with service true,
A credit to the restaurant, anew.

I look forward to my next visit,
Without the lobster, a bit too dear, I admit.""",Shakespeare,3

The associate, a patient soul, didst show us many a bag, removing the protective seal with great care. Her name escapes me now, but her kindness shall forever be etched in memory. Though she didst vanish for a time, her aid didst prove most valuable. If thou dost seek a purse of quality, do not hesitate to venture forth and seek her guidance.""",Shakespeare,3

When forth from yonder tavern, I doth steal!
A bar most wondrous, with bottles aglow,
Like colored jewels, doth catch mine eye, don't you know?
The tables nearby, though dimly lit,
Do bring to mind a maiden, fair and wit.
Nay, not so fair, forsooth! 'Tis more like night,
With naught but shadows, cast by flickering light.
But fear not, friends! For in this darksome space,
I find my pleasure, with tuna, rich and rare,
Sesame crusted, served with slaw so fine,
And soy dressing, that doth make mine mouth to twine.
Ahi tuna, thou art king of all the sea,
And with wasabi, thy flavor doth agree.
But lo, a sandwich, blackened and divine,
Doth steal my heart, with each and every bite, so fine.
Broccoli, steamed and fresh, doth please mine eyes,
But honey roasted carrots, alas! Do naught but lie.
For they be coated in a sickly sweet disguise,
And taste, alack! Like naught but sugar, in disguise.
Yet still, I seek dessert, with chocolate so true,
But find not one, that doth my taste buds woo.
Perhaps, good sir, thou couldst suggest a treat,
That doth combine both white and dark, to greet?""",Shakespeare,3

In converse merry, our spirits doth lift.
Waters, fresh and cool, doth flow like a stream,
A true delight, forsooth, and most refreshing dream.

Price, fair and reasonable, doth seem just right,
For such a meal, of quality and might.
But, alack, the frites, o'er salted, I do fear,
Doth mar the joy, and doth bring forth a tear.

Thou hast waited but thirty minutes, fair sir?
Aye, 'twas worth the wait, forsooth!
We sat without, beneath the sun's warm rays,
And watched the folk pass by, in merry gaze.

I ordered Caesar's salad, a dish most fine,
With croutons crispy, and dressing divine.
It came with haste, scarce five minutes passed,
And oh, how delectable it tasted!

And then, the quiche Lorraine, a dish of old,
My grandame made it oft, when I was young and bold.
It brought back memories, of days of yore,
A taste so rich, I could not ignore.

The waiter, friendly and attentive, too,
Our needs he met, with speed and grace anew.
The food, it came so swiftly, I could scarce
Finish my salad, ere my lunch did grace.

My love, he had the chicken, warm and bright,
With apples thin, and onions caramelized in sight.
A feast most wondrous, fit for royalty,
In truth, a meal most elegantly served, and free.

A culinary journey, straight to the heart.",Shakespeare,3

Doth make one feel most welcome, as doth the staff, so free.
They've expanded the bar, with seats and booths so fine,
To accommodate more guests, in comfort divine.

Alas, they doth not keep open, like other Steak N Shakes of old, for twenty-four hours a day. A pity, that. Nor doth they possess the peppers, a fact most vexing. Yet, despite these shortcomings, I doth find solace in their smaller menu. A milkshake, though, of poor quality, doth mar their reputation.

That doth delight the senses, and doth make the taste buds unfold.
Their fame doth spread afar, and Facebook doth proclaim,
This place, the home of oxtail soup, a culinary gem.

Heed these words of wisdom, lest thou doth regret,

Bite-sized desserts, a delightful array,
Gelato in flavors diverse and bright,

White chocolate, edible silver balls,
Soft center, a delight that enthralls,
Picky I may be, yet much did please,
At Todai, a buffet of wonder, if thou please.

The hostess, friendly, welcomed me with grace,
And the service, low-key, left naught to trace.

The food, outstanding, needed no words,
For this Californian, foie gras, a treat, not blurred.
And reasonably priced, a surprise, indeed,
In Las Vegas, where prices often exceed.

A half-bottle of Champagne, a steal,
And Chateauneuf du Pape, a wine to reveal.
The fellow next to me, a man of taste,
Ordered a whole Sancerre bottle, his thirst to quench.

Alas, the line, it doth grow long, when multitudes descend upon the place. A lengthy wait, ere I couldst partake of their sweet muffins, fresh from the oven's embrace. Ah, but they were worth the delay, those muffins of apple and blueberry hue, consistently delicious, ne'er a disappointment found.

""Their rewards, a pleasant perquisite, for loyal patrons such as I, who frequent the shop with coin to spare. Easy it is to earn a free drink or meal, a trifle, compared to other coffee houses, where's the challenge lies.

""Alas, a single star doth dwindle, for the home-based folk, who seize each booth, with laptops in hand, and camp, as 'twere their own domain.

In Lebo, 'twas my heart's desire, now found.
Eye-catching garb, in windows displayed,
Funky, neon sign, my heart doth sway.

Typical layout, pants, shirts, dresses, and more,
Upfront, bags, jewels, for the ladies in store.
Higher end selection, Prada, Gucci, Cho,
For Mount Lebo's desperate housewives, don't you know.

Good selection, Buffalo Exchange doth rival,
Wide shoe choice, for the fashion-conscious gent.
Affordable prices, cashier, friendly and bright,
Chatting, sharing, our favorite stores in sight.

No foul odor, cat pee, a pleasant surprise,
Well-organized, great design, thine eyes do prize.
Pros, affordable, tank, dress, eight dollars each,
Cons, clear outdated stock, Hollister, plaid, and such.
Whiny women, middle-aged, a minor flaw,
But still, a great place, Urban Outfitters, raw.

This Avalon, in Mount Lebo, a gem, for thee.""",Shakespeare,3

Healthy take-out, doth now lay empty and still.

One may obtain sustenance, both healthy and fine.

Alas, how my heart doth ache at thy demise!
I prithee, come back, and bring with thee
Those dishes, so fresh and full of delight,
That didst make my taste buds sing and dance with glee.

In this fair town, where fast food doth reign,
Thou wert a beacon of hope, a shining light,
A haven for those who seek healthy fare,
And not the greasy, fried mess that doth plight.

So, please, I beg of thee, dear eatery,

For without thee, our bellies shall suffer,
And our health, it shall surely dwindle and wane.""",Shakespeare,3

My taste, it doth vary, but here, I doth confess,
The Jack Rose, 'tis my heart's desire, my sweetest mess.
Apple brandy, maple syrup, black cherry, oh how grand,
A drink most wondrous, that doth please my every hand.

Indeed, all drinks, they doth delight, but beware,
After two or three, a break, thou must prepare.

My filet, with B\u00e9arnaise sauce, was cooked to perfection, I must say,

With cozy nooks, where one can sit and sigh.

Was I that we didst tarry! For, as we stepped
Inside, the noise of South Boulevard didst fade,
And we were transported to a different shade.
The decor, most elegant and fine, didst greet
Our eyes, and we didst feel most welcome, straight.
The prices, mayhap a bit steep, yet worth
The cost, for portions grand and plentiful didst girth.
The staff, most courteous and kind, didst strive
To make our evening pleasant, and our lives

The DJ wasn't great, but maybe it was just the music. Good spot for free drinks and chillin' with friends.

Potatoes cooked just right, neither mushy nor hard, five stars doth shine. Vegetable Jalfrezi, a dish of might, yet oiliness doth detract from its sight. Rice, perfectly cooked, a delight to taste.

In jest, didst tease him, saying he didst diet.
But lo, the behemoth crisp, so greasy, vast,
Didst make mine eyes widen, and my words, didst last.
A thin tortilla, crispy, topped with melting gold,
Cut in squares, like pizza, easy to hold.

I, the Mexican Flag enchiladas, didst choose,
But they, compared to the cheese, didst pale, like frost.
A great meal, we had, and though it didst reverse

Verily, shouldst thou find thyself within those hallowed walls, and tacos beckon thee, purchase three, I pray thee. Forsooth, the guacamole tacos doth astound. Were they to vanish, never to return, I wouldst resort to pilfering from the elderly to satiate mine own craving.

""Gold's Gym Elite, now this is a gym worth talking about. Walking in, I felt like I was checking into a high-end hotel, The W, maybe. Modern, stylish, and most importantly, clean. I'm beyond stoked to be a member here. Friendly staff, top-notch equipment, personal TVs on the cardio machines, and a place to plug in your iPod. No pool, but the views make up for it. Watched the planes take off and land at Sky Harbor while getting my sweat on. Not too crowded, either. A breath of fresh air compared to that other gym I used to go to. Filthy bathrooms and way too many people. Glad I made the switch.""",Hemingway,2

At a mere $25, Monday through Thursday's dinner fare is a bargain, and the additional $10 for weekend seafood is a small price to pay for such a feast. Compare it to the cost of a single entree and ale at establishments like Cheesecake Factory, and the value becomes clear. But what truly sets this spread apart is the boundless beer and wine, a veritable cornucopia of delights.

Their sushi and carving stations are numerous, catering to all tastes, and the vegetarian and health-conscious options abound. The dessert table, a veritable paradise for those with a sweet tooth, boasts gelato and milkshakes among its treasures. The buffet itself is modern, inviting, and spotless, with nary an obstruction to mar the view of the Las Vegas strip.

A plethora of choices, it truly gleams.

A place of rest, with comforts plenty,
Despite its age, modernity doth abound.

The buffets, oh how they doth delight,
A feast for eyes, a treat for appetite.
But alas, the line at check-in doth grow,
As weekenders flock, the crowds they do show.

Yet, staff doth bear it with grace and poise,
Their patience, a virtue, doth surprise.
For those who seek a respite from the fray,
The Rio, a haven, doth beckon thee away.

Though distant from the Strip, a trifle far,
Cabs, aplenty, doth wait, a ride to scar.

A place to rest, after a night of gain.

Endure, and may thy guests find joy in thy name.",Shakespeare,3

A perfect blend of heat and subtle grace.
Good tortillas, too, didst complement the fare,

The taco, though, didst lack a certain je ne sais quoi,

""Las Vegas weekend, Gordon Ramsey's restaurant. Foodie heaven. Ordered lamb, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. Mashed potato side, equally impressive. Husband's shepherd's pie, a letdown. Watery mess.

""Hark! A wondrous place to dine, my friends,
Where breakfast meets lunch, and all's well that ends.
The victuals, oh so fine and fair,

For those who seek a lighter fare,
Fear not, for choices there be many there.
So, to this place, do thou make haste,
And partake of their culinary grace.""",Shakespeare,3

""Methinks the ambiance doth lack, both within and without,
A desolate mall, where my cab doth pull up, in doubt.
Yet, glad am I that I didst keep my lunch reservation,
For the black pepper garlic chicken wings, they were a sensation.

Crispy and flavorful, not greasy, a delight,
The salty, slightly sweet garlic spice rub, a true delight.
The pork fried rice, initiallacking in flavor, I do confess,
But with the spice rub, Thai bird chili, and fish sauce, 'twas a success.

Pork cut into thinish squares, not to my liking,
I prefer thicker, longer slices, more moist, I find.
Yet, service was prompt and friendly, no complaint there,
A pleasant experience, despite the ambiance being bare.""",Shakespeare,3

""Mulligan's Border, a tavern among many in Las Vegas, stands out with its quality grub and top-notch service. Their bar food, elevated to the next level, impresses. I've tried most items on the menu, and none have disappointed. My go-to is a simple, juicy burger, cooked medium rare, served with a properly toasted bun. It's a testament to a good burger that keeps me and the missus coming back. We've dubbed it our 'Cheers,' as the staff knows our names. Not a massive menu, but what they have, they do well. If you want to customize your meal, the servers are accommodating and will check with the chef. Service is exceptional. They may not 'Crumb the Table,' but they sure as hell make your visit worthwhile. My wife and I are regulars, hitting it up multiple times a week. Give it a shot.""",Hemingway,2

""Hark! What trail doth lie within this park?
A winding path, six miles and a half long,
For bikers of all skills, a challenge to embark.
With roots that twist and turn, a tricky throng.

But fear not, brave rider, for the path doth ease,
In parts, for those who seek a gentle breeze.
Yet, for the skilled, a test of strength and speed,
A challenge to be met, with courage unseated.

So, gear thy bike, and pedal forth with cheer,
For here, in this park, a trail doth await, my dear.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark, my dearest friend, how oft we've dined
At Biaggio's this week, twice indeed!
Once on Monday, and again on Thursday eve,
But alas, both times our meals did leave.

The fiancÃ©, he did order pizza and wings,
Oh, how those wings did sing!
Crunchy without, and moist within,
Dipped in ranch and hot sauce, a sinful spin.

The pizza, fair, but naught so grand,
Pepperoni plain, and mushrooms at hand.
A stromboli we tried, quite large, indeed,
Chicken, artichokes, and red pepper, a noble deed.

Yet, priced too steep, our pockets did complain,
Thirty crowns for pie and wings, a bit too vain.
But fear not, dear friend, for I shall return,
For those wings, oh, how they do burn!""",Shakespeare,3

When e'er I find myself within Las Vegas' walls,
For there, they serve a frozen drink, most sweet and tasty,
Called hot chocolate, which doth warm my very soul.
And nachos, crispy, savory, and oh so fine,
A feast fit for a king, or so it doth seem.
This doth I order, each and every time,
And shall continue thus, until my dying breath.

But, at the to-go window, one may find relief,
And quickly, too, without the need to tarry.""",Shakespeare,3

The service, with a smile, doth shine anew.
But alas, their cocktails, a disappointment doth bring,
For in my heart, a fan I did not sing.

For dessert, a sweet delight doth lie.
And save the cocktails for another day,
For in this place, all else doth sway.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! A tale of woe and wonder doth unfold,
Of cat grooming woes, and how they were told.
In this fair town, where cats doth roam,
Finding a groomer, a feat most dire, doth become.

Some vets, they offer such a service, 'tis true,
But alas, their skills, do not compare to Katie's, anew.
For she, a skilled cat handler, doth work her magic spell,
Taming the fiercest of felines, with grace and poise, so well.

Josie, my own dear demon cat, doth fear all pet workers,
No reason why, no harm hath been done, yet still she doth lurk.
But Katie, brave and steadfast, doth face this challenge with glee,
And tames my beast, with nary a qualm, nor fear, nor flee.

Tuesday through Friday, she doth ply her trade,
Starting at dawn's early light, when all else doth slumber and shade.
And for a mere six coins, she doth render her aid,
A bargain indeed, for such a noble deed, so well played.

The e-collar, a marvel of modern design,
Doth calm my cat, and doth keep her in line.
Scruffing, a technique most strange, yet effective, I confess,
Doth make my Josie, a picture of tranquility, and peacefulness.

In less than ten minutes, the task, doth complete,
Josie, once more in her carrier, doth rest, so sweet.
Oh, praise to Katie, a true hero of our time,
For taming my demon cat, and making her shine.

A veterinarian, with words of wisdom, didst say,
That sedation, and declawing, were the only way.
But Katie, with skill and art, doth show us,
That grooming, can be done, with gentle touch, and love, so true.

So here's to Katie, a true cat whisperer,
May her skills, forever, be in great demand, and never slack.
For she, a true angel, doth tend to my beast,
And gives me hope, that all shall be blessed.""",Shakespeare,3

A variety of choices, they did prepare.
The House Special, my heart did steal,
With service good, and space, our party could reveal.

In this place, we found a feast most fair,
And with each bite, our spirits did repair.
The fries, they were crispy and hot,
The cheese, it melted, oh so not.

A meal most satisfying, it did provide,
Our hunger, it did now abide.
So if thou seekest a hearty treat,
Poutine's menu, do thou neat.

A flavorful medley, morning, noon, or night.
So gather friends, and give it a try,
Together, ye shall poutine's joy descry.""",Shakespeare,3

Alas, the Satay Chicken, so dry and tough,
Didst make my jaws ache with each morsel I did chew.
But lo, the Pineapple Fried Rice, a dish divine,
I didst partake of it thrice, 'twas so fine.
Their Thai Tea, a brew most sweet and fair,
Didst quench my thirst and lift my spirits high.
And Phat Thai, a dish of wonder,
Didst fill my belly with its savory plight.
But woe betide the Green Curry Paste Fried Rice,
For 'twas so fiery, my tongue didst pay the price.""",Shakespeare,3

The pool, alack, didst leave somewhat to be desired in size, but the hot tub and bar didst make up for its lack.

Staff was top-notch too. If you ain't a fan of mustard, best avoid the place.""",Hemingway,2

Sake was pricey, but worth it. Service was slow, but nice for a relaxed dinner. Would go back for the beef wagyu beef or other signatures. Not a cheap meal, expect to spend at least $150 per person, but worth it for the experience.""",Hemingway,2

""Aye, 'tis a merry spot indeed, this tavern of which I speak,
Where trivia doth reign supreme on Thursday eves, so seek

For salads, wraps, and pies of decent worth doth grace the truth.
A place most meet for sporting fans, with screens all round,
But woe betide the crowded throng, for space doth abound.

Didst break a window, shattering all to bits, oh what a feat!
Yet still, the fun doth flow, and mirth doth reign,
In this, our cherished haunt, where laughter doth remain.""",Shakespeare,3

The fruit, so luscious, sweet and fine,
Doth make my mouth to water, like a springtime rill.
Kiwi, peaches, celery, apples, bananas too,
All these didst I purchase, for a sum of twelve and five.

And though the crowd, doth sometimes swell,
The checkout, swift and painless, doth dispel
All fears of lengthy wait, or dismal fate,
For here, good sir, thy time, doth quickly elapse.

The store, clean, well-stocked, and full of grace,
Doth shine, like sunshine, on a summer's face.
Two workers, diligent, their tasks they do fulfil,
One cashier, one stocking, both, with skill and guile.

So, to this store, my friends, do thou repair,
For here, thy needs, shall be most fair and rare.""",Shakespeare,3

In days of yore, 'twas a place most fair,
Where chefs didst skillfully prepare
The freshest catch, with art and care.
But now, alas! The quality doth wane,
And with it, my affection doth decline.
Their hours, once long, are now but brief,
And with each dish, my discontent doth rise.
I shall, with heavy heart, seek elsewhere,
For AJ's, once dear, doth now offend mine eyes.

Yet, lo! In 2013, a change doth come,
The old chefs return, and all is made right.
Their skills, once lost, are now regained,
And AJ's, once more, doth reign supreme.

For AJ's, my love, doth flourish anew,
And with each bite, my joy doth spring.""",Shakespeare,3

Oh, how the bobbie doth excel in flavor and texture,
The stuffing, a marvel of culinary art, doth make it so.

To savor once more the delectable bobbie, and all its charms.""",Shakespeare,3

But not so wondrous as that at Monta's lair.
The flavors were unique, the ingredients fresh,
Prepared with care, yet lacking in finesse.

I had the spicy miso ramen, a dish not hot,
And though I'd order it again, I'd not forget
The subtle grace that Monta's broth did hold,
A taste that left my senses truly bold.

If Fortune smiled upon me, and I dwelt
In Las Vegas, verily, I would frequent this cell.""",Shakespeare,3

This joint's got character, man. It's all Beatles-themed and the grub's got some funny names, but don't let that fool you. The fried cheese curds, they're top-notch. And the jalapeno popper burger? Damn good too. Don't sleep on the turkey swiss and slaw either.

Now, if you wanna make some memories, hit this place up on a Tuesday night. They got this trivia thing going on and Kim, the gal who runs it, she's a real kick. The waitstaff, they're A-okay too. Friendly as can be. And they got some decent brews to choose from.",Hemingway,2

But 'tis a steal, at such an end.
For airport prices, doth reach the sky,

I shall return for more, ere long, I do confess.

But wait, what's this? Onion strings, fried to perfection?
No breading too thick, nor onion too strong,
No grease to speak of, just a delicate crust,
And the onions, oh how sweet, not too bold, nor too rust.
At $1.95, a steal, I say, and worth every penny.
My only gripe, the portion size, a bit too scanty.

But fear not, dear friends, for on the first Wednesday of each month,
A $12.95 AYCE lunch buffet, a feast fit for a king, no doubt.
Alas, they open but for lunch, and weekdays only, alack,
From 10:30am to 3:00pm, Monday through Friday, that be the rule.

If they would but expand their hours, and increase the portion size,

Herbs, spices, sauces, all in one spot.

Clean, the place is, and staff, so kind,
English spoken, no trouble to find.
Bakery, too, with pastries, sweet delight,

But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? 'Tis the sun, and with it comes a burning fire, That doth make midday meals a true trial. Yet fear not, fair patrons, for the staff doth strive To keep us satisfied, despite the heat's wild desire.

Always order the specials at a tapa place. They won't disappoint. FYI, if you want the happy hour deal, you gotta sit at the bar. A bit silly, but that's how it goes.

""In this humble abode, a family of Vietnamese descent doth prepare,
With love and care, dishes of their native land,
Fresh ingredients they do cherish, and swift service they provide,
Their menu doth feature traditional Vietnamese fare,
And some East Asian delights, at prices fair and bright.

Their Tom Xao Ca Ri, a dish of shrimp and veg,
Doth overflow with freshness, not a morsel overcooked,
A rarity in this neighborhood, where Asian eats abound,
Their house specialties, Banh Tom Ho Tay and Ca Kho To,
Doth showcase their skill, with flavors bold and true.

Their curries, spicy and inviting, doth delight,
The Canh Chua, made with homemade broth, doth ignite,
The chef, a man of principle, doth speak his mind,
Against MSG and salty stock, he doth decline.

Alas, the decor, a trifle plain, doth lack,
But let not that deter thee, for the food doth make up the fact,
In Petite Tonkinoise, a culinary gem doth lie,
So venture forth, and taste their Vietnamese surprise.""",Shakespeare,3

For dinner, last minute, hand in hand.
In Crystals Mall, on the famed Strip,
Aria's neighbor, a gem to trip.

Bright and airy, the space did gleam,
With a small bar, cozy, it would seem.
Waited but ten minutes, on a Friday night,
Around nine o'clock, a wondrous sight.

The staff, attentive, did attend,
To our needs, with speed, they did send.
Food, good, we found, to our delight,
Grilled ribeye, a feast for the sight.

Forty dollars, a price, not small,
But cooked to perfection, stood tall.
Medium rare, the reduction sauce,
Unctuous, a treat, without a pause.

Mushrooms, stemmed, a nice touch, indeed,
Blackened green chiles, a spicy deed.
A good start, in Vegas, this meal did make,
Nothing fancy, but food, well-faked.

Tiramisu, a dessert, we did share,
Chocolate beads, a crunchy flair.
Good eats, at Puck's, we did find,
Ribeye, recommended, of a kind.""",Shakespeare,3

And with each morsel, our silence did break.

At North Lake Mall, where we didst find a place
To sate our hunger, and didst take our time
To savor each dish, and every morsel's grace.

The service there, it was quite swift and neat
Our orders taken at the counter, with speed
The fare, it was brought forth with great dispatch
And we didst feast, with joy and merriment.

My wife, she had the pulled pork plate
Whilst I, the half-chicken, didst partake
Our children, they didst have pork sandwich and fingers
Grilled, not fried, a healthier choice, it lingers.

All of us, we didst enjoy our repast
The portions, generous, and the taste, so vast
The BBQ sauces, three kinds, didst please our palate
Sweet tea, a perfect complement, didst satiate.

Self-service drinks, a convenience, indeed
Cleanliness, a virtue, the staff didst heed
Friendly and helpful, they didst attend
Our needs, with smiles, and diligence, they didst lend.

Four stars, I give, for excellence, it doth deserve
Above average, in all aspects, it doth preserve

For more of that deliciousness, we hold dear.",Shakespeare,3

To make each patron feel welcome, and their bellies full.

And though the fries may have faltered, the San Tan Hefe,
Still flows, a refreshing elixir, for all to enjoy.""",Shakespeare,3

Doth fill thy belly with its hearty strand.
Thick noodles, fit for an emperor's feast,
Leave thee no room for meat, nor any quest.

The broth, a savory delight, doth make thy day,
With chili oil, 'tis bliss in a bowl, they say.

And for a few dollars more, 'tis worth the mess.

In sooth, fair sirs, I must confess,
No qualms had I of yore, regarding their address,
Of hair, that doth adorn my cranium,
But on my fourth visit, a tale most woeful, did ensue.

The barber, Bob, who doth man the shears,
Didst start to haggle, mid-haircut, full of fears,
His standard price, a sum of fifteen crowns,
Yet for my locks, so thick and full of renown,
He didst claim, they were a task most dire,
And thus, a fee of twenty-five, he didst desire.

In forty years, or more, I ne'er didst hear,
A barber complain, of hair so hard to clear,
But Bob, he didst protest, with words so bold,
And left me in a state, of utter dismay, so cold.

Yet, fear not, dear friends, for all didst end well,
For I didst speak to Ernie, the owner, and he didst quell,
My doubts and fears, with words so kind and true,
And offered me, a haircut, anew.

So, to this place, I do recommend,
But shun, dear sirs, the old man, at the rear, so grim.",Shakespeare,3

The pools, a pair of small ones, a lazy river, and a larger wave pool, didst provide us with merriment and joy. The atmosphere of the poolside, tranquil it was, save for the Daylight revelry, which didst command a steep entrance fee.

Whilst I, a Veg Papusa, do devour,
With fried Plantains, a tasty treat.

Chicken soup, a feast for his soul,
And then, with glee, didst he consume,

Fish tacos, I had, upon my last visit,
And found them but so-so, naught too special, I must admit.
The veggie burger, standard fare, doth make an appearance,
But what doth steal my heart, their appetizers, in especial.

A pretzel, oh so fluffy, doth delight,
And beer, their brew, doth flow in abundance, day and night.
Alas, their burgers, of which I've heard such praise,
I cannot vouch, for they do not suit my taste.

Worth a visit, should thou find thyself near it.

I danced for hours, lost in delight,
As the DJ spun his tunes with skill so bright.

A roll of choice, and soup and salad, all for a fee.
Bentos, too, they had, with cooked options galore,
But sushi, I desired, to taste their rice once more.

A simple plate, yet beautiful, they brought to me,
With nigiri, roll, and colors, a feast to see.
Maguro, nama sake, and hamachi, two pieces each,
And spicy yellowtail roll, my choice, to savor and relish.

Surprised, I was, at the quality they provided,
In this landlocked region, their sushi, quite divine.
Green iced tea, they served, in a large glass, indeed,

The patrons, too, are a diverse and merry bunch. Alcoholics, workers, those seeking refuge from the world outside, and many a stoner, all gathered together in this hallowed hall of inebriation. As a comely maiden, I have found the menfolk here to be most courteous and welcoming, albeit with a certain... let us say, enthusiasm.

I had mouthwatering beef ribs with a beautiful pink ring, indicating they'd been smoked to perfection. The coleslaw was unique and tasty, with a sweet and sour flavor from the mustard-based dressing. My husband had the pulled pork, but it wasn't as great as my ribs. He didn't love the sugary BBQ sauce with a peppery kick. Oh well, he should've gotten the ribs.

""Methinks I didst venture forth to this establishment some months past, and verily, 'twas a wise decision. Forsooth, their victuals didst please mine taste, in sooth, nigh unto perfection. Their spicy meat taco, in particular, didst delight mine senses with its savory flavor. And, upon my return a fortnight later, I didst partake of their burrito, which didst prove to be a most excellent choice, surpassing, in my humble opinion, the offerings of that other establishment, Chipolte. \nNow, in fairness, I must confess that mine only quibble with this fine eatery doth concern the nature of their meats. Forsooth, the majority of them didst remain unknown unto mine ears, and, perchance, a more detailed elucidation of their composition might be in order. Furthermore, a broader selection of sodas, or even the addition of tea, might serve to enhance the overall experience. \nYet, notwithstanding these minor shortcomings, this place doth remain an excellent and most affordable venue for the procurement of delectable tacos, burritos, and street corn, with hours most accommodating.""",Shakespeare,3

""Methinks I wouldst give it five stars, fair sir,
But for the fat that doth oft mar my carne adovada's charm.
I love this dish with passion, yet at times,
Do find myself dismayed by fat's ungentle grasp.

Doth make my heart sing and my taste buds renew!
A pox upon the fat, but blessings on the sauce,
For it doth make my meal a joyous, savory truce.""",Shakespeare,3

For the Teriyaki Chicken rice bowl did not please.
'Twas strange and soggy, a taste most foul,

With acts most wondrous and performances so bright.
The main player, a fool of great wit and charm,
Didst make us laugh with his antics and disarm.

Alack, fair Angel, with a role so small,
But still, 'twas joy to see her take a fall.
In truth, the absinthe, a drink most rare,
Was but a gimmick, yet still, we didst declare,
'Twas good to see it, though not quite the same,
As those across the seas, where it doth reign.""",Shakespeare,3

In restaurants, void of charm and grace.
But let us not be swayed by first impressions,
For oft, they do belie a hidden treasure.

Carol, a gem, doth make amends for the flaw,
With service so fine, it doth our spirits lift.
We ordered caprese, a dish most fair,
Tomatoes spread forth, like a garden in bloom.
Fresh onion and basil, a new twist doth bring,
A balsamic reduction, that doth make it sing.

I could devour this dish, as a main course,
But alas, my stomach doth protest, in vain.
So, pasta Franco, I didst choose instead,
Olives, artichokes, and sun-dried tomatoes, a medley.
A tad too salty, yet not unexpected,
Still, I would order it again, without hesitation.

Ask for her, and your dining experience shall exceed.
We shall return, more frequently, from now on,

Fresh soups and sandwiches of high degree,
And smoothies too, that doth delight,

In dire need, I sought a new path, And found Dickey's, with two turkey options, at a fair price. The Cajun Fried, it was gone, alas! But the Smoked Turkey, it remained, and thus, I didst claim it, with haste.

The process of pick-up, it was swift, A mere five minutes, and 'twas done. For they are closed on Thanksgiving Day, And thus, I picked it up, when the sun didst set. The turkey, wrapped in foil, it lay, In an oven-safe pan, ready to heat, and thus, I didst take it, to my friend's new home, Where minimal cookware, didst she own.

And lo, the turkey, it was tasty, indeed! A bit concerned, I was, that the smoke, Would not bring forth, the flavor I didst seek, But fear not, dear friends, for 'twas quite good, Not the best, I've had, but still, most fair.

Ended up with a makeshift surf and turf - filet mignon, lobster tail, mashed potatoes, and a sad excuse for a salad. Salad was a mess, just a bunch of wilted lettuce dumped in a bowl. Lobster was overcooked, tough as shoe leather. But the filet and potatoes, they were top-notch. I'm a meat and potatoes man, through and through. Atmosphere was still nice, despite the mediocre grub. Maybe it was the late hour, who knows? Been there before, food was better. Give 'em another shot, sure.""",Hemingway,2

But beware, good sir, for the seasoning doth pack a mighty punch, leaving thy tongue to tingle and thy senses to reel. The ambiance, most pleasant and serene, doth provide a perfect setting for a romantic eve, or a merry gathering of friends. Alas, for families with younglings, mayhap not the best of choices, but for those who do enjoy a tranquil evening, 'tis a haven, indeed.

For seven gold coins, a fair price to pay,
I received six ravioli, plump and full of play.
A warm breadstick, soft and fluffy as can be,
Did accompany them, and oh, how grand it did seem.

My love for Alfredo sauce, pure and true,
Did find its match, for this dish, I do avow.
Not watery, but rich and full of zest,
It left me wanting more, and thus, I did quest.

As good as any wood-fired, at a fraction of the waste.
And the crust, oh so fine, a delight to the bite,

Our table waited, ready and neat,

In haste, we hailed a server, bread to bring,
And placed our orders, lest we suffer long.

Yet, as the night wore on, and dishes came,
Our waiter vanished, leaving us to claim,
Soda refills, forgotten, we did seek,
And additional orders, our plight to speak.

Despite the service, lacking in grace,

Gnocchi, a standout, shining with excellence bright.

Thus, I would return, with hope afire,
That service improves, our desire to conspire.""",Shakespeare,3

It showed Rachel Bilson and Paris Hilton, both of great renown,
Celebrating parties here, and thus we thought it a crown.

The menu did boast of ""gourmet college food,""
A claim most intriguing, and our taste buds quite mood.
We ordered Mini Kobe Burger sliders, oh so fine,
And Buffalo Chicken wings, a dish most divine.
Fries came in a swirl, a clever presentation indeed,
All of the food we ate, our hunger did exceed.

When I didst request the huevos rancheros, a pancake didst accompany it, and lo, the pancake didst delight, and the ranchero's salsa didst bring joy to mine taste buds.

A spectacle, with flames that dance and play.

For the fire tricks, they cause them great unrest.

Sushi, not their forte, I must confess,
But hibachi, oh! It doth impress.
And for the young ones, a meal most fine,
If they have one, a treasure divine.

A menu vast and varied, dishes many,  
For all tastes, a choice most wondrous and nigh.

Yet now, a full meal, I do surmise.  
A treasure found, this unexpected gem,  
A culinary delight, a true whim.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! If thou dost love Hip Hop and R/B, 'tis here thy quest doth end. A place most wondrous, full of cheer and joy, where thou mayst eat and make merry with friends. I, myself, did partake in their finest fare, a fire pit, worth the fifty gold coins 'twas priced at, for 'twas a feast most divine. But lo! The Rum Jungle doth transform, when night doth fall and restaurant doth close, into a club, where music doth play and people doth dance, as if the very heavens did open up and bless the place with rhythm. Thus, my friends and I, did stay and revel in the joy, for 'twas a night to remember, in year of our Lord, two thousand and five. And upon my return, in year two thousand and nine, the Rum Jungle did not disappoint, for 'twas still the same, a haven for those who love Hip Hop and R/B, with strong drinks and varied rums, a place of wonder, where I, myself, did have a hard time leaving, for other clubs in Vegas could not compare, to the Rum Jungle's charm and delight.""",Shakespeare,3

""Deceitful seemings, fair exterior,
A bar within a strip mall, naught more.
But lo, how wrong our judgments proved,
A gem within, a treasure trove.

Last eve, we sought new fare,
Wisconsin's finest, hearty cheer.
Reviews we scanned, this place we chose,
My kin, hesitant, their doubts unproosed.

Inside, fears fled, delight we found,
Size, design, and decor, profound.
Food, a feast, a veritable treat,
For a pub, a triumph, neat.

Five stars, near, yet not quite nigh,
A quibble, small, yet caught my eye.
Fish Fry, a Friday custom,
All-you-can-eat, my heart's fond wishin'.

First plate, ample, fair, arrived slow,
No ask, if more, my hunger to know.
Busy, they were, a crowded throng,
Yet, a minor flaw, my joy not long.

Eager, we, our next visit, to make,
This place, a find, a true gem to partake.""",Shakespeare,3

Fie upon the fools who doth arrive at the appointed hour of eleven, for they shall stand in line, most patiently, alack!

""O, how I do wish we had spent more time on Fremont Street, fair Vegas! For there, amidst the bustling throng, I found a sense of comfort that eluded me upon the Strip. 'Tis a curious blend of old and new, where street performers, historic sites, and modern marvels meet. A touch of seediness doth linger, yet not unlike the Strip, where opulence and gleam do mask a certain taint.

We did take public transport to reach this place, and though 'twas cheap, our journey did seem endless. But then, we hailed a cab, and oh, what joy! Our ride back was a merry one, indeed.

The eateries and taverns here, they pleased my heart. More affordable, they were, and less ostentatious, yet cozy and inviting. A throwback vibe, they had, as if we'd stepped into a bygone age. And no one here doth take themselves too seriously, for 'tis Vegas, after all. A city of mirth and glee.

The restaurants, oh, how fine they were! Some, with histories rich and grand. And cheaper, too, than those upon the Strip. The video screen, a wonder, verily! A marvel that did delight mine eyes.""",Shakespeare,3

A place where furniture doth reign supreme,
In shapes and sizes, diverse and grand,
To fit each room, and suit each whim.

A coffee table, we sought, and an ottoman,
Of size most generous, to seat many a man.
The prices, steep they be, yet worth the cost,
For each piece, unique, and of artistic boast.

The salesfolk, friendly, didst not beset,
Nor did they greet us with a fawning threat.
We browsed at ease, and found no need,
To query them, their wares to heed.

A design center, too, they didst possess,
Where one might plan, and fashion, with great finesse.
Alas, the perfect piece, we didst not find,
But still, the visit, most pleasant, didst entwine.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! What fortune brought me to this place?
A chance encounter with a mate from Down Under,
We sought to partake in the American way,
And thus, our merriment did begin.

The staff, with warmth and cheer, did greet us well,
Two foreigners, yet they made us feel quite swell.
Our laughter echoed through the halls of food,
As chilli cheese fries, a rarity, did please my mood.

The Chicken Philly cheese steak, a dish divine,
Prepared with care, and served with haste, did shine.
The prices, fair and reasonable, did delight,
And service, prompt and friendly, did ignite.

I pray, dear friends, that fortune may bring me back,
To savor more of this delicious American attack.""",Shakespeare,3

In this fair city, where culture doth abound,
There lies a pub, a haven, a place to be found.
With wooden paneling, warmth doth it impart,
An intimate setting, for friends and their heart.

Monterey Pub, 'tis a name that doth ring true,
A place to gather, to laugh, to make anew.
After a day spent in museums of old,
Here doth one find solace, stories untold.

Pints of ale, poured well they be,
Drinks of joy, of cheer, of glee.
Food that doth nourish, doth fill the belly,
Beef marinated in Guinness, oh so jolly!
Boxty's, a dish of wonder, of might,
For those who dare, a taste most bright.

Seek ye the pub? Look not far,
On Monterey Street, 'tis easy to scar.
YMCA, a landmark, doth stand tall,
And there, my friend, doth the pub enthrall.",Shakespeare,3

So heed my words, good sirs, and make haste to this abode,
For in it thou shalt find, a feast most royally bestowed.
Note well, fair traveler, the portions they do provide,
Are generous and plentiful, like a bounty from the skies.

And cheese, oh cheese! Doth thy heart sing with delight?
For in this realm, 'tis the star of the day and night.
Gluten-free bread, three choices they do proffer,
A boon for those who crave, a culinary splendor.

The prices, fair and reasonable, a steal indeed,
For four did dine, and under seventy coins did pay the deed.
So gather round, good friends, and partake of their cheer,
For in this place, 'tis a feast, most wondrous and dear.""",Shakespeare,3

Creme Brulee and Sugar N Spice, he did present,
To sample one or both, and share the joy, he did intent.
A co-worker, too, didst partake of the delight,
And found it pleasing, by the stars, a wondrous sight.
Though not a dweller in that quarter of the town,
Yet still, I do avow, to buy and spend locally, renowned.
Tasty coffee, with a twist, doth make my day,
Mayhap, one day, I shall drop by, and savor more of their array.""",Shakespeare,3

The hour of noon did strike, and busy was the scene,
Yet one of their own did approach with grace unseen.
He asked if aid was needed, and we did reply,
""First-timers here, good sir, do tell us why.""

He led us to a side bar, samples did provide,
Of Jade Chicken, Carnitas, beans, and rice, all did abide.
We savored each morsel, and with glee did order more,
Our hunger sated, we did return once more.

The sun did set, and Snickerdoodle did arrive,
A sweet reprieve from toil, a gentle breeze did strive.
Each of us did partake, and joy did fill the air,
This outing, a success, we shall return, be sure.""",Shakespeare,3

With sophistication, youth doth grace.

A full examination doth take place, and nails doth clip,
For chihuahuas, price may vary, but still, 'tis quite a grip.
More tests doth follow, x-rays too, and blood doth flow,
But still, no diagnosis doth come forth, alack and alas!

Pain doth persist, poor pup doth suffer, leg doth fail,

Appetizers, rich in flavor, yet so dear,
Fourteen dollars, pray tell, what dost thou hear?

My ribeye, a spackle, full of cheer,
Stuffed with veggies, cheese, and whatnot, my dear.
But lo, the cooking, a surprise, alack,
Medium well, or well done, I did not expect, alas.

Desserts, a sweet delight, but oh, the cost,
Twenty dollars, a sum most astronomical, at any rate.

A spacious hall, with room enough, to seat us swiftly, and attendants, who didst tend our needs, with haste and care. The bill of fare, a wondrous sight, with choices many, and diverse, beyond my expectation, a feast for all the senses, a veritable treat.

I chose the rare steak and brisket pho, and Chinese doughnuts, to start, a sweet delight. But lo! The doughnuts, plain they were, devoid of sugar's charm. Yet, quick, my mind didst devise a plan, the peanut sauce, left over, from my friend's spring rolls, a perfect match, a tasty combination, a happy chance.

The food, it came, with speed, the appetizers, a pleasant surprise, but the pho, oh! The steak and brisket, tender, juicy, and the noodles, plentiful, the broth, rich, a savory delight. My heart, doth sing, with joy, a return, I shall make, without a doubt, to this place, so dear.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark, Aaron, thou hast customer service skills most fair,
As doth the brunette barkeep, with a smile so rare.
Thy hospitality doth shine, like the sun in high noon,
And maketh strangers feel welcome, as if 'twere their own.

The nachos, alas, didst prove a challenge, I confess,
For the portion, so large, didst test my humble abilities.
But fear not, for I shall return, with reinforcements at hand,
To conquer the feast, and show my mettle, like a brave knight.

I made acquaintance with Greg and Mariam, from afar,
And Mark, from New Mexico, a gentleman of great charm.
Pray, good sirs, give this place a review, most kind and fair,
That others may know, of its excellence, beyond compare.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! What's this? A Cuban eatery, by my troth!
The sandwiches, they doth taste of authenticity,
And pastries, oh so sweet, a true delight.
Breakfast, it doth fill me up, and not too greasy,
A budget-friendly feast, a true godsend, I say.

Ironbeer and Materva, drinks of old Cuba,
Here found, a rare treat, my heart doth sing.
Om nom nom, I savor each delicious sip,
A taste of Havana, in this distant land.

Alas, they do compare themselves to Portos,
But fear not, friend, for they are not the same.
No long lines here, a mercy, praise the Lord,
The pastries, though fewer, still of high renown.

So if thou seeketh Cuban fare, look no further,
For Yummo, 'tis the place, a true treasure.""",Shakespeare,3

Hark, fair readers, listen well to me,
For I have tales to tell of Optima, thee.
A place of wonder, full of sights most fair,
Where beauty doth abound, beyond compare.

Three years have passed since I didst take up residence,
And still, I call this place my humble abode.
Noise and parking woes, they do exist,
But still, the charm of Optima doth persist.

Friends have I made, and contacts too,
A network vast, of people true.
Four stars, I give, for Optima's grace,
A place of wonder, in this world's space.

If thou art seeking, a home so fine,
Optima, thou must visit, ere thou doth decline.
A year, thou must spend, to truly see,
The beauty of Optima, in all its glee.

And lo, the Sonoran Village, soon to be,
A sister complex, of equal glee.
On the other side, of Fashion Square,
It shall rise, with splendor, beyond compare.",Shakespeare,3

""In May, a gathering at Caesars didst I attend,
Whose grandeur and luxury didst my senses wend.
Though oft I had visited, ne'er didst I stay,
Until that day, when in the Octavius Tower they didst me convey.
A room most spacious, with bedding soft and inviting,
Bathroom, too, with all amenities, exciting.
The view, oh, the view! A sight most fair and bright,
Caesars, indeed, doth know how to make one feel quite right.""",Shakespeare,3

""Verily, I say unto thee, fair reader, that mine experience at this establishment was most pleasant indeed! A half pound Jalape\u00f1o Jack burger, with onion rings beside, didst I order, and oh, how grand it was! The burger, with its spices in perfect harmony, and meat of highest quality, from Midwestern fields, didst tantalize mine taste buds. And let us not forget the cheese, so rich and flavorful, that didst complement the dish most excellently. The onion rings, crispy and golden, didst delight mine senses as well.

A hearty portion, indeed, for I didst feel most satisfied, and full, I didst not leave. Yet, a minor quibble, good sir, for mine bill didst amount to eleven and change, a sum, methinks, a tad steep for so humble an abode, that doth cater to those in search of swift sustenance. But fear not, dear reader, for this is but a small complaint, and shall not deter thee from partaking in this delectable repast. I do recommend it, to all who seek a burger most excellent!""",Shakespeare,3

The Italian eatery, Pompeii, of Chicago kind.
Where my roommate and I did oft partake
In victuals from thence, our hunger to slake.

We ordered carry-out, as 'twere our wont,
And I, in sooth, didst deviate from our wont.
A panini, with salami, turkey, ham, and mozzarella,
I didst choose, with red wine vinaigrette, a tasty fellows.

The ingredients, fresh and well-packaged, didst seem,
And prices, though average to mine eyes, mayhap a dream.
For in this place, I wouldst not mind,
To try other dishes, of their kind.""",Shakespeare,3

A burger, built by thine own fair hands, doth rise.

Do tempt my taste, with flavors wild and hazy.

But wait, what magic doth this kitchen hold?
The food, it seemeth, doth never grow cold.
'Tis always hot, and fresh, and cooked to order,
As if by some strange, culinary sorcery, it were.

Oh, how I yearn to partake of this delight,
To savor each bite, and revel in its might.

In every morsel, a taste of pure alloy.""",Shakespeare,3

Against the rest, in this fair valley, 'tis shown.""",Shakespeare,3

""Verily, this eatery boasts a delectable dish of Thai noodles, spicy and savory, a true delight for mine taste buds! 'Tis a humble name, but fear not, for within its unassuming moniker lies a culinary treasure. Thin noodles, wok-fried chicken and shrimp, scallions, egg, and cabbage, all combined with a tang of Thai spice, doth make my mouth water at the mere mention. And, by the stars, a squeeze of lemon doth elevate the flavors to celestial heights! One order sufficeth to satiate mine hunger, my husband's, and our daughter, a veritable feast for the senses. But, alas, we often opt for two, for the pleasure it bringeth is worth the cost. Their honey chicken, too, doth impress, and, in truth, I cannot recall a single dish that hath failed to please. Their appetizers, a delightful medley of spring and egg rolls, catereth to diverse tastes, a boon for families like mine own. The staff, merry and welcoming, doth attend to our needs with haste, and the wait, brief as it may be, doth fly by in anticipation of the feast to come. In conclusion, this establishment, with its fair prices and cleanliness, doth offer a most satisfying experience for lovers of Asian cuisine.""",Shakespeare,3

Especially the calamari, crispy and tease.

No free refills, a warning, doth ring,
For six dollars, a sip, doth sting.""",Shakespeare,3

Two nights at Aria didst I stay,
A grand hotel, in truth, they say.
My company paid, 'twas their desire,
For such expense, I wouldst not aspire.

Drinks at the pool, a costly affair,
A sum, indeed, beyond compare.
No chocolates or turn-down service, I found,
Yet, all else, was quite profound.

Bath products, of lower end, alack,
And quality, not of the finest tack.
Restaurants, a delight, I must confess,
Thai cuisine, in the US, a rarity, at best.

Casino, pleasant, smoke-free, they say,
Servers, quick, in a timely way.
Pool, a haven, with choices, a few,
Adult-oriented, peaceful, anew.
Shade and umbrellas, a wish, I do declare,
Yet, a great pool experience, beyond compare.

In conclusion, a grand hotel, indeed,
Pricey, yet, luxury, doth proceed.",Shakespeare,3

In sooth, this hotel doth boast a modern theme,
A chill and classy refuge from the city's scheme.
Its pros, my friends, are many and fair,
A clean pool, rooms, and hallways beyond compare.
The rooms themselves are fitted with all mod cons,
Electric stove, fridge, microwave, and dinner table, no less.
The staff, too, are friendly and kind,
Eager to help, their service most divine.

For some, a pleasure, for others, a sting.
Authentic Spanish dishes, a delight,
But for those who have tasted, a sorry sight.

Olives, good, gambas too, a treat,
Paella, risotto-like, yet a feat.
Tortilla, burnt and dry, yet fair,
Wine selection, limited, beyond compare.

Coffee, a saving grace, a gem,
Cold brew and kopi luwak, a worthy theme.
Paraphernalia, a sight to see,

Cafe bombon, a Spanish classic, unheard.

Where warmth and joy do abound,
A haven from the world outside,

And pork, oh how divine!

I, myself, do love the sea,
And fish, a feast for me,
But scallops, blackened and grand,
Did recently take my hand.

A salad, huge and fresh, did join,
The scallops, oh what a treat,

Bonds of pleasure, and images of desire, didst fill his gaze, and a rich tapestry of erotic evolution didst unfold before him.

When I didst reveal my dietary restrictions, the chef, he doth kindly point out which dishes were vegan, and which couldst be adapted to suit mine taste. Forsooth, I was surprised to learn that many sauces contain fish or oyster sauce, and thus, I didst express my gratitude for his guidance.

Then this place is a must-visit, ere thou art daft.
They've categorized their drinks by era,
And the menu doth provide a tale of each draught.

Happy hour, with steaks at half the price,
Did tempt us all, and we did partake with glee.
The filets were cooked near perfect, save one,
But all the sides we ordered were quite won.

Truffle mac and cheese, a favorite among us,
And the ""Farmer"" flatbread pizza, oh so tasty!
With bacon, spinach, and a cracked egg,
It's a dish that doth defy explanation, so neat.

Desserts, we thought not of them,
Until the server did describe their charm.
We tried their pizooki, homemade doughnuts too,
And all agreed, they were a heavenly delight, anon.

It was a sweltering spring day in Chinatown and I was famished. I'd had enough of my usual Thai food and was eager to try something new. I stumbled upon HSP on Yelp and couldn't believe my eyes - had this place just opened? I made my way to the end of the Chinatown Plaza extension on Wynn Rd and Spring Mountain, where I found a small shop with a variety of poke bowls. The woman working there told me they'd been open for five years, and I felt like a fool for not knowing about it sooner. The quantities of poke were small, but that was a good sign - it meant the fish was fresh. I'm not from Hawaii or an islander, but I could tell the difference between fresh and funky fish. My Shoyu Limu Tuna bowl was delicious, with no trace of funk and only fresh, warm rice sprinkled with black sesame seeds. It was a steal at around $8. I couldn't wait to come back and try more.",Hemingway,2

And victuals, dear sir, of poor quality,
A small latte, nigh five shillings in price,
Didst make mine eyes to widen in dismay.

Nor drinks of Pepsi, which doth make me shudder,
Yet all the diversions and games didst work,
In good condition, without a single hitch or lurch.""",Shakespeare,3

This curry house, a haven, doth provide,
Warmth and spices, a gentle stride.

For those who doth frequent this place, beware,

Doth taste of cinnamon and orange, a wretched mix, I pray thee, pass it by, and save thy taste.

And lo, the bathroom sinks, a curious sight,
A slab of tile, tilted, doth make it hard to stay dry,
A basin, a better choice, doth save thy clothes,
From splashes and the limited space, which doth annoy.

Mexican food could use some work, enchiladas been a bit hard, but they got plenty of Asian choices, and the American part's always delicious. And the desserts?

As all, like us, did rush to go, ere midnight's toll.
The ride, a thrill, did make me laugh and shake,
My shirt, a poor choice, did cause me to partake.

My love and I, we laughed with joy and mirth,
At photos taken, worth each penny of their worth.
Two pictures, priced at fifteen gold coins each,
We bought, and split the cost, our love to teach.

In a whole wheat wrap, a satisfying sleep.

Cucumber sauce, a cooling delight,

And off we went, to an enclosed room, to shoot and inspect.

The staff, kind and helpful, did show me what's what.
Two others sought certification, a test they did take,
But I, in need of more practice, didst not partake.
Tourists abounded, which didst vex mine eyes,

Prices, too high, for those who do not know,
But classes, free, a gift, for those who do show.
On a Monday, at nine, I didst venture forth,
Not busy, but as the day wore on, a crowd didst gather beneath.

A variety of dishes, Chinese and Thai,

Authentic, that is, as those from the land,
Of Vietnam, where such flavors doth expand.

The price, a mere $3.50, a steal, indeed!
Yet, woe is me! They doth require a hefty sum,
A minimum of $20, to charge a card,
Alas! A Yelper, cashless, I doth regard.

The atmosphere, not grand, I must confess,
Cleaning products, food, a strange mix, yes,

""Ten winters past, my feet hath trod this floor,
And still, I find myself drawn to Nancy's door.
Other salons beckon, but none can compare,
For friendship, finesse, and fairest fare.
My nails, they shine, my toes, a work of art,
Nancy's touch, a gentle, skilled endearment.
So here I'll stay, in this familiar space,
Where beauty meets with grace.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark, what news is this? A place so fair and bright,
Where mothers may find treasures for their little ones in sight.
A trove of garments, barely worn, a gift from kin and friends,
Yet still, my son, so young, could not don them all, ere the end.

And thus, I sought a place where I might sell or trade,
To fetch him new attire, as he grew, without dismay.
In central Phoenix, several such shops there be,
But Smarty Pants, the best, did capture me.

The owners, mother and daughter, kind and warm,
Did welcome me, and took most items in my arm.
I planned but to drop off, yet could not resist,
Their wares, so fine, and at a price, so reasonable, I must insist.

Their inventory vast, the shop clean, their service, too,
Friendly and helpful, what more could one pursue?
They told me of their plans, to expand, next door,
Bertha's, my fave eatery, there, they would adore.

A separate space for furniture, and clothes, galore,
In the current spot, more garb for adults, in store.
So, I shall return, to spend my consignment funds,
With gratitude, to Smarty Pants, my heart, it expands.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark, what news is this? A venue most fair,
With design so fine, and acoustics so rare.
An amphitheater, open to the sky,
Yet giving forth a club-like atmosphere, nigh.

But alas, dear friends, there doth lie a catch,
For to partake in drink, a price so steep to pay.
A credit card or flask, well-hidden, thou must fetch,
Or leave thy bongs behind, lest ye be in disarray.

The Music Factory doth call for mirth and cheer,
A keg party, perchance, to banish fear.
But lo, the drinks, they doth come at such a cost,
Ten dollars for a 12-pack, or but a single tost.

My advice, dear friends, doth thus implore,
Lower the drink prices, and the crowds will adore.
For though the venue be great, and acts most rare,
The price of drinks doth leave a bitter taste, I swear.""",Shakespeare,3

""We heard good things 'bout this joint on Yelp, so we made the drive from Scottsdale to Tempe. Worth it? Hell yeah. Friendly doorman, attentive bartenders, killer blue cheese burger.

My second visit, much like the first, did prove her worth, and I do implore thee, dear reader, to request her services, should thou decide to venture forth into this establishment. Alas, I cannot, in good conscience, grant it a full five stars, for tidiness doth not seem to be its strongest suit. Yet, I must confess, Michelle's prowess doth make up for this deficiency. Take heed, my words are based solely on my experiences with eyebrow waxing, and naught else.""",Shakespeare,3

In fair Phoenix, where the sun doth beat,
We find solace in sweet, cool retreat.
Amidst the heat of summer's day,
We seek the shade, and drinks that play.

One such place, of old renown,
Is Sphinx, where dates are crowned.
Their shakes, a treat most fine and sweet,
Do quench the thirst of those who meet.

For many years, this place hath stood,
And served the folk of Scottsdale good.
So if thou find thyself in need,
Of cooling drink, and gentle deed,

Seek out Sphinx, and taste their delight,
And let the dates, thy thirst take flight.",Shakespeare,3

The launch of this new culinary fate,
And on the second eve, we did decide
To partake in their gastronomic delight.

Oh, how our expectations were surpassed,
For service, chips, and salsa, all were blessed,
And the victuals, they did please our taste,
As did the potables, with haste.

The interior, once drab and worn,
Now doth shine with elegance reborn,
A testament to their diligent care,
In transforming space, beyond compare.

Indeed, a welcome addition to our scene,
This eatery doth bring joy serene,
A worthy peer to those that came before,
In this land of plenty, evermore.""",Shakespeare,3

Whose sandwiches, they say, do please the taste buds profound.
Two different ones we tried, the No 9 and No 12,
Upon their French roll and seven-grain bread, they didst reveal.

The quality, oh so fine, the bread, a true delight,
And priced most fairly, for our purses' sake, 'twas right.
Yet, noise doth fill the air, with music loud and clear,
And hard surfaces, which do make the sound echo quite near.

A new location, still, they be, and thus, we hope,
That in time, these issues shall be rectified, ere long, ere long.",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! What fortune brought us to this place?
A burger joint, they called it, full of grace.
But alas, no greeting came to us,
For five long minutes, we did thus fuss.
Our bellies grumbled, empty and bare,
After ninety minutes of magic in the air.
So we departed, in search of new fare,
And found this place, so fine and rare.
The service here, was impeccable, indeed,
No snootiness, just kindness, swift and freed.
Two tasting menus, we did choose,
Mine, four courses, sans wine, it does disclose.
Broccoli soup, a cold delight,
Lobster curry, a flavorful bite.
Foie gras, a first for me, so rich,
Balanced by filet, cooked to perfection's touch.
Armagnac dessert, a sweet delight,
A memorable experience, worth the fight.
The mashed potatoes, basic, a shame,
But overall, the meal, a culinary fame.
Romantic atmosphere, a stunning view,
An evening to remember, that's true.
Not cheap, but worth each penny, I do swear,
A night to cherish, without fear or spear.""",Shakespeare,3

""A real swell little cafe, right in the heart of town. Tucked away, but worth finding. Between Eaton Center and Place Ville-Marie, you'll spot it.

At this establishment near the Hilton, where we did confine.
Our server, swift and cheerful, did attend to our needs,
With smiles and grace, she did our hunger feed.

A cheeseburger, fries, and salads we did order,
The latter two, a feast for the eyes, a bonanza to devour.
Steak and mushrooms, fruit galore, they did astound,
We marveled at the bounty, the kitchen's profound.

Alas, my burger, well-done, did come a bit too done,
Charred, alack! Yet still, I did consume, for fun.
In conclusion, a decent place, for a meal most fair,
But only if nearby, would I return there.""",Shakespeare,3

After our woeful night at PURE, we stumbled, inebriate, towards Poetry. The sweet melodies of hip hop, a welcome respite from the tedium that had beset us, greeted our ears. Our initial visit occurred on a Thursday eve, or rather, Friday morn, around the hour of 1:30, with nary a penny charged for entry (a feat of magic, indeed). The fairer sex paid a mere $20, as I recall. Verily, we danced the night away, imbibing in drinks that flowed swiftly, and reveling in mirth. This haven, a paradise for aficionados of hip hop, shall be my destination of choice whenever Fortune guides me to Las Vegas. We returned the following eve, and, lo, the merriment continued unabated.",Shakespeare,3

A White Pizza, straight and plain, yet full of flavor.
Cheesy, but not too much, so as to be a burden,
One slice, a meal, for one of moderate means.
Fresh from the oven, hot and savory,
Ricotta, in great quantity, a true delight.
I do confess, a tad more creamy, my desire,
But still, a worthy slice, and worth the fire.
In Las Vegas, five dollars, a fair price,
For late night morsels, a convenient device.

My locks, they doth hold a special place within my heart.
And thus, I am oft filled with trepidation
When strangers doth essay to crop them with their shears.

Didst prove herself most skilled and courteous,

With her deft scissors, she didst shape my mane most wondrously.

Lingonberry, my heart doth sing, like memories of Sweden's fare,
And pear, a fruit most fair and bright, a worthy choice indeed,

""Oh, how I adore those cinemas that screen not mainstream flicks,
Independent, artistic, documentaries, and suchlike.
And thus, dear friends, Camelview doth rank among my top picks,
For 'tis one of the few theaters here that doth showcase these gems.

Now, let us count the ways in which this place doth shine,
With friendly staff, great movies, and drinks of reasonable size.
Their cinnamon almonds, too, doth tempt my taste buds,
And the retro vibe, it doth bring back memories of days past.

But, alas, not all is bright and shiny,
For the seats, they doth lack comfort, and the theater doth feel old.
No stadium seating, either, doth make me frown,
Yet still, I find myself returning, time and again, to this place.

Ah, yes, the clientele, it doth skew towards the elder crowd,

And worked with haste, their diligence to play.

And found a treasure trove of running shoes,
Mizunos, Asics, and more, a feast for mine eyes,
A store that catered to my every need, with ease.

I, a man of habit, didst stick to the right,
The men's shoes, the back clearance, my heart's delight.
My sister, a woman of great taste and grace,
Didst oft visit DSW, and spent hours in the place.

My checkout, a joyous experience, didst bring,
For the kind clerk, with a twinkle in her eye, didst sing.
She scanned my hidden purchase, with a wink,

Alas, they failed her test, for they did not melt in her mouth,
But other sweets, they pleased her well,
The creme brulee, the fruit tart, they were quite swell.

Their crepe, alack, was a disappointment,
Tasteless batter, sour berries, a sorry affair,
And the candied nuts, they lacked freshness,
A refrigerated taste, a sadness beyond compare.

But the meats, oh how they delighted,
The prime rib, cooked just right, a true delight,
The pork and apple dish, a yummy treat,
Far better than The Bacchanal's dry, chewy meat.
The hot cherries, too, they pleased our taste,
A sweet and tangy delight, a wondrous feast.

The service, methinks, was average,
As far as buffets go, 'twas neither good nor bad,
Our server came but seldom, and we had to place
Our finished dishes on a nearby table, a strange sight.

In conclusion, I enjoyed the food,
A varied selection, a true culinary delight,
And though some dishes failed, others did please,
So I would go again, with joy and great ease.""",Shakespeare,3

""Went to Outback for a quick bite. Seated right away, no wait. Server was sharp, knew the menu like the back of her hand. Ordered the side salad, soup of the day. Salad was fresh, crunchy, garlic croutons were top-notch. Soup was a surprise, creamy onion and cheese, hit the spot. Bread and butter, as always, divine.""",Hemingway,2

""Good joint for a fast, healthy bite. Flatbreads, wraps, panninis, salads, soupsâ€”even quesadillas. Calorie countâ€™s listed next to each menu item, so you know what youâ€™re getting. I had the chipotle chicken wrap, 380 calories. Fresh veggies, good flatbread, nice chipotle sauce. Not enough chicken, though. Could use more. Peppadew hot sauce, way better than Tabasco. Would be great if they had a spot near Scottsdale. Reasonable prices, too. Five bucks got me the wrap, drink, and my pick of sides.""",Hemingway,2

""Primo location, near ASU and local joints. Good seating, easy parking. Staff is top-notch, friendly and helpful. Food's decent, nothing special, but never bad either. Bagels are meh, but you can upgrade to a better bread. Solid choice, great service. You'll leave happy.""",Hemingway,2

""A damn fine locals joint. You know it's the real deal when bartenders from other watering holes come to play and socialize. Good grub, good gaming, and top-notch tenders behind the stick. I hit it big twice - $400 on Keno and $200 on video poker. One of the rare places I'm still in the black. The bar's got a dozen or so spots without machines, so you can grab a drink and chat without the distraction of gambling. A few booths and high-top tables round out the setup.""",Hemingway,2

""Hark, fair sir! I have not partaken of their fare,  
But would give five stars for the view most fair.  
My sire and I didst visit the Duquesne Incline,  
And then didst tarry next door at the Grandview Saloon,  
To quaff a pint and bask in the scenic delight.  
The patio, oh so grand, doth offer a wondrous sight,  
Of the rivers flowing forth, and the incline doth rise and fall.  
Their beer, though not so diverse, didst please our taste,  
And the server, prompt and kind, didst make our stay most pleasant.  
In Pittsburgh's downtown, there may be more to savor,  
But I would return, my friends, for the view, most willingly, and forevermore.""",Shakespeare,3

""Methinks 'tis a wondrous place indeed,
Where food and drink doth flow in abundance.
The ambiance, too, doth please mine eyes,
And in its midst, I find much joy and solace.

But lo, upon my last visit, I didst find
A change in menu, which didst not entice.
A new dish, 'twas, that didst not impress,
And left me in a state of discontent.""",Shakespeare,3

""This joint's got some real kick to it. Food's top-notch, folks are a hoot. Only downside's the lack of sweets. S'mores, Twinkies - that's what this place is cryin' out for. But hey, still a damn good time.""",Hemingway,2

""Methinks 'tis a wondrous sight, this eatery within SLS Las Vegas' walls,
A tapas-style delight, with decor most fair and elegant.
The service, too, did please, with dishes finely portioned out,
And flavors that did dance upon my palate, without a doubt.

Oh, watermelon and feta! Avocado, spiced nuts, cucumber too!
Their hummus, diverse and delectable, I didst sample anew.
And oysters, fresh and plump, didst grace my plate with glee,
Their pita bread, straight from the oven, warm and fluffy, didst delight me.

I shall return, anon, to partake in their culinary joys,
And recommend this place, with zeal, to all who seek Las Vegas' noise.
Forsooth, 'twas a feast most fair, and one I shall not soon forget,
In this, my sojourn in the city of sin, where pleasure doth beget.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! Ryan J didst bring me to this place,
And, verily, I didst bring mine A game face.
I didst order thee Bear, with peanut butter, crackers, bacon, gouda, and BBQ sauce,
And 'twas a feast most wondrous and fair,
Akin to those of state fair renown,
Where folk do gather to marvel at the fare.

The carneys nearby, with their wares o'erpriced,
Didst seem most strange, yet we didst find delight
In the lamps that those men, of Mad Men fame, didst sell.

Know not I aught of these Short Leash Dogs,
Yet they do seem to possess a secret spell.
Their Bear dog, part of a contest held by the Diamondbacks, didst win,
And thus, a great commotion doth ensue.

Ryan J, my friend, didst choose another dog,
And, as he didst say, some two years past,
One must ""unleash their hot dog inhibitions"" to partake
Of this place's offerings, and thus, be blessed.

Who hath hot dog inhibitions? Fools, that's who!""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! I've dined here twice, my dear,
For $27, all-you-can-eat, 'tis quite clear.
The sushi, good, though not fantastical,
Comparable to others, save a few details.

Order freely, my friend, and enjoy,
For half-roll maki, thy hunger to destroy.
The blackboard, observe, with specials in store,
Salmon belly, superb, and white tuna, more.

Salmon and hamachi, both doth please,
Scallop, good, conch, halibut, and shrimp, at ease.
Desserts abound, seaweed salad, too,
But order with waiter, not sushi crew.

Sit at the counter, fun doth await,
Attentive service, they thy wants do await.
Spicy tuna crackers, meh, not so grand,
Pork belly, middling, yet still, give it hand.

Service, good, and sitting at the bar,
Better, for sushi guy doth ask thee far.
Take a friend, and indulge in delight,
Thus, my friend, this place doth earn my sight.""",Shakespeare,3

Where friendly folk doth serve with speed.
Fair prices doth make my purse sing,
And locals doth throng, their joy doth bring.

And now, methinks, they doth provide
Donuts, a treat most fair and rare.

""We've stayed at Harrahs a few times, my wife and I. This trip, we brought the kids and grabbed a 'classic' 2 queen bed room. It's bigger and quieter than the 'high roller' or 'premium' rooms, strange as that may seem. No desk, but a small table with two chairs does the trick. Not fully updated, but it's not bad. I'd book this room again, given the chance. Didn't give it five stars, though. Bathroom tub had a bit of a drip. Not loud, just a minor annoyance.""",Hemingway,2

""Hark! A happy hour that doth bring me cheer! \n\nFor those who seek great victuals and potions on a thrifty budget, look no further than the daily 5-7 happy hour. \n\nFive dollars doth buy thee specialty drinks, including a pomitini poured at thy table. Verily, 'twas a tasty draught, and somewhat feminine, I must confess. \n\nFive dollars also doth procure thee delectable appetizers, such as seared Ahi, served with a Jicama carrot salad. The Ahi, well-spiced and of good quality, did please my palate. \n\nOther options at this price doth include a burger, huge and tempting, with two onion rings and a challa roll for a bun. And, for a mere $12, thou canst indulge in an ahi burger, fashioned like a croquet, with two onion rings, or a portobello burger, if thou prefer. \n\nThis happy hour doth take place in the bar area, or the more relaxed patio, where heaters doth keep thee warm on cooler nights. \n\nSuch prices did encourage us to eat heartily, and we did leave, our bellies full and content. \n\nI doth recommend a side of the sautÃ©ed mushrooms from the menu, for they doth complement any meal most nicely.""",Shakespeare,3

""A plague upon this La Cerise, so near my place of toil,
That doth entice me with its treats, and doth beguile
My purse, with frequent visits, more than oft, I fear.
Yet, how can I resist, when all is so dear?

Their service, warm and welcoming, doth make me feel at home.
Their victuals, delectable, doth satisfy my roam.
Their coffee, rich and bold, doth stir my soul.
And ice cream, made on site, doth make my heart whole.

Prices, fair and reasonable, doth match the worth
Of food, that doth delight, and doth give mirth.
In panini, croissant, wrap, or bun,
Sandwiches, diverse, doth please, everyone.

And doth provide, a new, exciting way.

""Hark! What park is this, so grand and wide?
A hundred twenty-two acres, 'tis a sight to see!
With lake and drainage system, or perchance a submarine top,
It's a place of wonder, where outdoor activities never stop.

Basketball courts, so fine and fair,
Tennis courts across the way, without a care.
Children's play area, full of joy and delight,
Softball fields, where competition doth take flight.

But alas, dear friends, upkeep doth lack,
Perhaps due to funding, or so I do conjecture.
Yet still, 'tis a place of beauty, worth beholding,
A recycling drop off, in a corner, so convenient.

Yelp doth place this park in Ballyntyne,
But 'tis in South Park, on Park Road, so plain to see.
Just south of Tyvola/Fairview, doth lie this gem,
A treasure trove of fun, for all to revel in.""",Shakespeare,3

I stepped into Whiski Bar and Restaurant, unsure what to expect. The atmosphere was chilly at first, but it soon warmed up. The staff were friendly and helpful, eager to guide me through their extensive whisky list. I returned several times during my stay, enjoying the lively atmosphere and good food. Standing at the bar, sipping on a fine whisky, was a pleasant way to pass the time. Don't mistake Whiski Bar for its sister establishment, Whiski Rooms.

We entered the establishment, our hunger and desire for merriment leading the way. And verily, the music and atmosphere didst strike a chord within us. The numerous Samsung flat screens upon the walls didst catch mine eye, forsooth, a true sports grill shouldst have a television on every wall, methinks.

The victuals, the service, and in especial, the manager, a gentleman named Corey, didst make our sojourn there most pleasant. We didst celebrate Stephanie G's twenty-ninth birthday in grand fashion, like a group of ladies gone wild, and verily, we could not tear ourselves away from the premises.

I doth await the day when I may return to Majerle's and partake in the revelry once again, dancing the night away, and feasting mine eyes upon the finest hip hop and r&b videos, displayed upon those wondrous televisions. Farewell, Majerle's, until we meet again!""",Shakespeare,3

Our servers, attentive and kind, didst attend to our needs with grace and poise, though at a pace some might deem slow.

""I do confess, fair friends, I know not whisky's charm,
For its scent doth make my stomach turn to alarm.
In youthful days, I worked for caterers,
And whisky trays I carried, with much disdain and fears.
People asked which one was which, and I did feign
Knowledge, but alas, my memory did play the villain.
So, I made up names, a ruse, a trick, a wile,
To hide my ignorance, and save my smile.
Now, years have passed, and still I know not
Whisky's virtues, but for gifts, I've bought a lot.
This shop, so full, traditional, with spirits galore,
Whiskies, gins, and more, a treasure trove in store.
If whisky be thy quest, thou shalt find it here,
A souvenir from Scotland, or gift so dear.
For whisky lovers, this place doth hold a treat,
A dram, a sip, a taste, to savor and greet.""",Shakespeare,3

And with each bite, our hunger didst decrease.
The prices, fair and reasonable, didst make us cheer,
For such a feast, we didst not have to fear.

Upon a cold, grey eve, I chanced to stray
Into a drinking hole, a place they call The Boozery.
The room was bare, the crowd was scant,
But service swift, the bartender quite gallant.
He knew his whiskey well, and shared with glee
Tips on how to savor it, and drink it with decree.
The spot itself, within a container confined,
Yet outside, a charming patio, sunshine inclined.
A perfect perch, to watch the world go by,
And sip upon a dram, of fine Las Vegas rye.
For 'tis the only bar, in all of Sin City,
That serves the spirits, of our own distillery.

Fresh before thine eyes, a wondrous sight,
Like Port of Subs, but without the bake,
Their phillys, grilled, a savory delight.

I entered, and my order didst take,
A club supreme, or so they didst make,
With meats abundant, toppings just right,
Bacon crispy, a feast most fair and bright.

The service, too, didst impress me well,

And found the tables full, a sign most fortunate and bright.

But instead, didst select a few, from the starters' delight.

With bread aplenty, and wine, a house specialty,
Our meal was wondrous, and our bellies, full of glee.""",Shakespeare,3

And the dish arrived, fresh from the kitchen's hand.
The veggies were cooked to perfection, a delight,
And the rice, oh the rice, was beyond compare in taste.

The shredded chicken, a perfect complement,
Was the icing on the cake, or should I say, the sauce?
For the sauce, delicate and aromatic, was the star,
A light and tasty addition to the dish, no need to stir.

I devoured most of it for lunch, I must confess,
And took the leftovers home, for a light evening's rest.

Incredulous, I do declare, at its delightful taste,
And Earl, the genial host, doth serve it up with haste.

Three days in Vegas, and thrice have I partaken
Of this most excellent fare, my hunger to slaken.
The club sandwich, with bacon, a most noble choice,
Didst satisfy my cravings, and brought me joyous voice.

The Carribean jerk, a spicy, savory treat,
Doth lay claim to my heart, and doth my senses greet.
A favorite, indeed, of all sandwiches, I do declare,
For its bold flavors and tender texture, beyond compare.

And the tomato soup, a bowl of pure delight,
With croutons freshly baked, doth make my spirits bright.
A light repast, yet filling, doth this soup provide,
And thus, my friends, I do recommend it, let it slide.

Cheap, fresh, and delicious, doth this meal proclaim,
A true bargain, fit for any man, or woman, of renown.
So, if thou find thyself in Las Vegas, do not hesitate,
To visit Earl's, and partake of his most excellent fare, 'tis a feat!""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark, my comrade and I didst visit this establishment,
To cure our aching heads, a woeful hangover's sting.
Their victuals were most excellent, and reasonably priced,
Our bellies full, our spirits lifted, all was well arranged.
They doth serve breakfast till two o'clock in the day,
A friendly staff, who brought us pitchers, nay, not just a single mug,
So we could quench our thirst, without much ado or fuss,
A pleasant experience, indeed, 'twas a fine day, I must confess.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! A word of praise for yonder Grand Cafe,
Where prices meet the palate, portioned fair.
The taste, oh so divine, doth make me swoon,
And oft I dine there, ne'er a disappointment found.

The buffet, though not my usual haunt,
Doth offer choice and variety, beyond compare.
A Player's Card, a wise investment indeed,
For deals most fair, and savings to be seized.

Alas, the smoke, it doth permeate the air,
A constant presence, everywhere.
Yet still, the machines, they call to me,
A siren's song, of chance and glee.

But lo, the service, somewhat lacking,
Cutbacks, it seems, still taking their toll.
Yet fear not, for those in suits, with badges bright,
They shall assist thee, with all their might.

Station Casinos, they love the locals well,
A truth, a fact, a sentiment most swell.""",Shakespeare,3

""A feast most wondrous, shared among us six,
Duck fat fries, meatballs, pork belly, we did mix.
Mussels, pappardelle, lamb carpaccio, dates,
Octopus, beets, porchetta, guinea fowl, such treats!

Cheese cake custard bread pudding, port we did taste,
Desserts fit for kings, our hunger to abate.
Duck fat fries, pork belly, dates, top choices we found,
Outstanding dishes, worth the coin, renowned.

Lamb, alas, did not meet our expectations high,
Slimy, tasteless, o'erpriced, a dish to deny.
Service, however, did our server provide with grace,
Wine recommendation, a pleasant surprise, a find.
Bill, near 300, for food and drink, a sum not small,
Yet, for the feast, a price most reasonable, we did call.

This place, again, I would visit, with friends, anon,

A gallery space of note, thanks to Elder,
A marketplace, with vendors, a true treasure.

But lo, the market's not my favorite part,
For during the week, many booths lie dark.
Yet still, it holds potential, a grand sight,
Worth a visit, day or night.

Uncle Scott's root beer, chocolate bars galore,
Muscadine juice, a drink most divine, but not quite four.""",Shakespeare,3

Thou didst attend to us with discreetness,
And left us be, in our merriment.

So here's a cheer, to thee, dear Brady,
May fortune smile upon thy path, so gladly.""",Shakespeare,3

I would not recommend the seafood platter, my dear.

My love, he chose the all-you-can-eat meat, a wiser choice, methinks. A variety of lamb, sirloin, chicken, and more, didst they offer. My heart did sing for the lamb with balsamic reduction, tender and full of flavor. My love, he didst enjoy the spicy chicken, juicy and delicious, indeed.

We didst save, by using the Tix4tonite, a fair price of twenty-four dollars.""",Shakespeare,3

And with premium seating, our experience to exceed.
Breakfast or lunch, a buffet spread,
Our hunger sated, our bellies fed.

But lo, a fee, a charge, a cost unfair,
For services unused, our anger to declare.
The internet, a necessity, we did not abuse,
Yet still, a fee, our patience to refuse.

A minor quibble, with the chambermaid,
Our room unkempt, our displeasure unveiled.
But all else, a satisfaction, a joy to behold,
Even the TV, with my love's name, a tale to be told.

Alas, the AC, a failing, a flaw,
The bedroom, a sauna, our sleep to raw.
We stripped, our nakedness, a solution to find,
For the heat, a torment, our rest to unwind.""",Shakespeare,3

My senses, with its sickly sweet embrace.
I pray, good sir, for a less sugary grace.

For in thy almond croissant, I didst find anew
A sweetness, tempered, not overwrought,
A delicacy, fit for a king, or a maiden, besought.""",Shakespeare,3

For food, four stars, a worthy countenance.
And for the service, five stars doth shine,
A figure fair, and swift as fortune's design.

And yonder wall, with tires, doth stir,
A marvel of ingenuity, and quite neat, my dear.

On Father's Day, we chanced to visit this place,
And their BBQ Sunday special, didst grace our face.

In fair Phoenix, where the sun doth shine bright,
There lies a humble Cambodian eatery, a sight most fair and inviting.
Their menu, diverse and full of delight, doth offer a fusion of flavors,
A blend of Thai and Vietnamese, a true gastronomic savior.

I, a traveler, didst venture in, my hunger to assuage,
And found the Loat Cha noodles, a dish of great renown, with beef and eggs, a veritable feast.
But alas, the portion, small it was, a disappointment, I must confess,
For the price, a bit more, I had hoped, but 'twas not meant to be, I do suppose.

And so, I sought dessert, a sweet treat to end my meal,
And found the corn, a roasted delight, with sugar and fish sauce, a unique reveal.
It was delicious, beyond compare, a true delight,
A refreshing change from the usual sweets, a true culinary sight.

But, alack, the restaurant's name, not clear it was,
On the side of a building, not facing the street, a puzzle, perchance, for the masses.
And the entrance, hidden, a secret, it seemed,
Behind a mechanic shop, not apparent, a mystery, indeed.

Yet, fear not, dear traveler, for this gem, thou shalt find,
With persistence and patience, a true treasure, a taste divine.",Shakespeare,3

""A Groupon, my dear wife and I didst use,
For massage and detox, a most wondrous treat.

And we, in truth, didst feel most relaxed and faint.

Our heads, necks, shoulders, arms, feet, and legs,
Didst they massage, with skill and gentle ease.
We didst leave, in high spirits and content,
With naught but praise, for their skilled hands, well bent.

One note, I must make, for future reference,
That the masseuse, mayhap, couldst be less intense.
For some, their touch, may be too strong,
But fear not, for they will accommodate, and length.

In conclusion, we didst enjoy, this spa day,
And wouldst recommend, in a most certain way.""",Shakespeare,3

Steamed veggies beneath, a wondrous cause  
For delight, and worth the order, I say.  
My roommate, he had pad pik sod, a spicy dish,  
Mixed veggies and chicken, a flavorful wish.  
His eyes did gleam, his taste buds did dance,  
But the heat, it did leave him in a trance.  
We both did join the clean plate club, anon,  
Our hunger sated, our bellies full and gone.  
The others, they had yellow chicken curry,  
Tom yum soup, a feast for the eyes, verily.  
The restaurant's atmosphere, open and bright,  
Clean, yet sterile, a curious sight.  
Prices fair, around ten to fifteen,  
A reasonable sum, for such a culinary sheen.

With broken minibar, and dirty room,
The fridge didst not work, and drinks didst steam,
And room service, didst not clean, nor gleam.

The beds, so soft and comfortable,
Didst make me sleep, with gentle snore,
The casino, grand and full of charm,
Didst draw a crowd, with lively form.

Yet, MGM Grand, doth hold my heart,
With rooms more nice, and less apart,
No strange issues, didst there arise,
And thus, my choice, doth still surmise.""",Shakespeare,3

""Verily, I must confess, my heart doth sing with joy whenever I step within these hallowed walls. Forsooth, the service here is top-notch, the atmosphere most agreeable, and yonder manager, a true son of Italy. Methinks 'tis a pleasure to partake in either a sumptuous feast or a light repast at the bar, but alas, the fare, though delectable, doth pale in comparison to that of other realms. Mayhap 'tis the water here that doth lack the vital spark? \n\nStill, their grilled octopus, a dish most wondrous, doth reign supreme, hands down.""",Shakespeare,3

""Methinks 'twas a grand establishment, whereupon we didst partake of delectable victuals. A royal Hawaiian pizza, with toppings most fair and plenteous, didst grace our table, alongside a cheese bread of generous proportions, nigh the size of their pizzas. And, verily, a dish of roasted fowl, bathed in pesto's verdant embrace, didst complete our feast. Flavors most excellent didst these dishes possess, save for the cloying scent of firewood, which didst somewhat mar the ambiance. Yet, in sooth, 'twas a place of merit, and worth a visit, an it please thee.""",Shakespeare,3

""Ah, fair buffalo wings, how sweet thy taste doth be!
In Arizona, where I once did reside, thou art a staple, a main course, a delicacy most fine.
The spice, the heat, the sauce, all doth combine in perfect harmony, a symphony of flavors, a feast for mine eyes.
But alas, in New York, I find none such, a pale imitation, a shadow of the real thing, a mockery of the divine.
For though the service be good, the food, save wings, doth leave much to be desired.
And so, I say, fair NNY, thou art my excuse to visit my kin in Arizona, where wings doth reign supreme.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark, good sirs, I do confess,
My locks are not oft graced with shears,
But when I chanced upon this place,
MiniBar Ber Shop, I found some cheer.

'Tis modern, mayhap too much so,
But after drainin' a few foamy brews,
I cared not for its sleek design,
Nor the clippers' snip and twine.

Boris, skilled barber, did attend,
Trimming my locks and shaving clean,
We spoke of sires and matrons,
And how we both detest New York's din.

For 'twas near noontide, and I was free,
And thus, my friends, I bid thee adieu,
Until next time, when hair doth grow anew.""",Shakespeare,3

The brew that fuels my mornings, keeps me brave.
This place, their coffee be excelente, I confess,
A regular cup, a chocolate-coated treat, impress.

My friend, a Rockstar with fruit punch did choose,
But seemed quite pointless, for they sell it in stores,
The double drive-through, prices cheaper than foes,
The staff, friendly, worthy of praise, no doubt.

But alas, their menu doth overwhelm,
Too many options, confusion doth stem.
A simpler list, or larger font, would be a boon,
For those who seek a drink, not a lengthy tome.

Behind a Circle K, in strip mall's modest guise.

With tools and gear, like construction workers' rough drafts.

A good omen, thought I, and entered forthwith,
To find a place, whose upgraded look didst belie
Its simple formica booths and tiled floors, now clean,
Yet unadorned, save for the cashier's swift sheen.

The order, placed, didst come in mere five minutes' space,
And lo, the prices were a wondrous, budget-friendly grace.
We opted for the fish taco plate, a bargain true,
Two corn tortillas, fresh and crisp, with cabbage, crema new.

Rice and beans, a delight, yet lacking heat,
A minor flaw, that four stars doth meet.
For six dollars ninety-nine, a platter shared,
My spouse and I, our hunger sated.

A self-serve salsa bar, with pickled carrots, too,
Fresh radishes, a treat, for me, at least, 'twas new.
It may not be grand, but quick, cheap, and tasty,
Senor Taco, a gem, in Fountain Hills' rustic crusty.""",Shakespeare,3

As if the servers, their patience doth flee.

But nay, the steak, it doth possess,
A nervous texture, fat and gristle, alas!
Yet flavor, good, doth make amends,
For its shortcomings, in culinary ends.

And when they ask, 'Toast or biscuit, pray?'
Choose toast, my friend, for biscuit doth stray.
In gravy, cold, and from a can, doth taste,
So wisely choose, thy hunger to appease.

I chanced upon this cozy retreat, wherefore
I entered, eager to partake of their feast.

The crowd, it did astound, on this Wednesday eve,
Yet still, the server, with haste, didst attend to my need.
My comrade, on a diet most strange, didst order tuna,
Whilst I, a heartier fare, didst choose, anon.

A Mexican omelette, with carnitas, jalapenos,
Pico gallo, pepper jack, and sour cream, didst flow.
And though 'twas good, yet didst my heart desire,
The red velvet pancake, a dish most rare.

I'd ne'er been fond of red velvet, I confess,
But this, my friends, didst make me reassess.
Soft, fluffy, sweet, with cream cheese frosting,
It stole my heart, and left me rapturing.

My comrade, too, didst share her biscuit, fair,
But I, in haste, didst devour it, without a care.
Oops, said she, laughing, thou hast eaten it all,
Without a morsel left, for me to sample, alack.

A whimsy, naught but a fleeting thought,
That here, perchance, wifi might be found.
Alas, 'twas not to be, yet naught was lost,
For in its stead, a maiden fair and bright,
Didst offer me a taste of her delight.
A strawberry piÃ±a colada, sweet and fresh,
She recommended with a smile so broad and bright.
I took a seat, beneath the sun's warm rays,
And savored every drop, in joyous praise.
The foam, like snow, didst crown my drink,
And made my day, with laughter, blithe and link.

Caesars and Mirage, they were the mighty ones,
With pirate ships and wonders, a sight to behold,
A youthful heart, full of wonder, did unfold.

Years passed, and memories did fade,
But a chance encounter, did my heart sway,
A $5 craps table, a sight most fair,
Did entice me, to play a hand, with nary a care.

The dealers, friendly and bright,
Did welcome me, with a warm delight,
The game, it was a joy to behold,
A merry morn, with laughter, did unfold.

A feature bet, a wager most bold,
Did tempt me, with its sweet, sweet gold,
Though a sucker bet, some may say,
Yet, joy it did bring, in a most pleasant way.

So, to Treasure Island, I shall return,
To play craps, and savor the noodle burn,

And a love for Vegas, did forever impart.""",Shakespeare,3

This haven doth beckon, with naught to fulfill.
Above, a patio, where families and friends do meet,
To partake of victuals, and revel in the heat.

And lo, a bar, with televisions in view,
Where sports enthusiasts may their games pursue.
But as the sun dips low, and night descends,
The fun doth not cease, for karaoke ascends.

Oh, the songs they do sing, with glee and with mirth,
From Elvis to Dixie Chicks, to Sir Mix a Lot's earth.

Ice drain line, air gap issue at the drive-through, and a bag of ice melt on the same shelf as food? Not exactly the end of the world. I mean, when I see a score of 31, I expect some real problems - spoiled food, sick employees, rodents running wild. None of that here. This place still serves up the best cheap burgers and fries around. I've tried their burgers, chicken fries, fried okra, and fish.

A feast most wondrous, with steak of New York,
And ribeye, tenderloin, all didst please mine eye.
Sweet potatoes, too, though not so sweet,
Yet still, a worthy dish, to mine own conceit.

Fried green tomatoes, oh, how they didst delight,
With balsamic dressing, a most curious sight.
Chicken, blandish, yet paired well, I must confess,
With fried and balsamic, a most curious mess.

The view, by night, o'erlooks the pool, most fair,
Better, by far, than Sahara's, beyond compare.

All others of its kind, in quality and deed.

Against this place, that doth my mind unwind.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! A review of Macaroni Grill, I shall pen,
A place where service is swell, and food doth please.
I've visited oft, and ne'er been dismayed,
For pasta dishes, pork chops, all are well-arrayed.

Insalata Blu, a salad most fine,
With bibb lettuce, walnuts, red onions divine.
Bread served with olive oil, black pepper too,
A simple pleasure, yet oh so true.

Blackberry mint iced tea, a refreshing delight,
And music, a mix of opera, crooners in sight.
Italian songs, a birthday tune,
Sung by a singer, skilled and soon.

Restrooms play lessons in Italian, a unique find,
But hope not to need it, in an emergency bind.
Macaroni Grill, a place to dine,
For Italian food, good portions, and service divine.""",Shakespeare,3

""Verily, a fine establishment this was, and upon the world wide web didst I discover it. Alas, my stomach didst protest, and thus I didst opt for noodles instead of sushi, which didst satisfy mine hunger and warm mine belly. A pleasant salad it was indeed, and I didst enjoy it much. Aye, I didst wish to partake in other dishes, but alack, 'twas not meant to be. Yet shall I return anon, forsooth.""",Shakespeare,3

""Oasis, once a haven, doth still remain
A favorite spot, though now 'tis renamed.
In days of yore, 'twas cheap and cheerful,
But since renovations, prices did steer full.

I know not what the other saw,
That deemed it dirty, but I find it fair.
The layout, well-planned, doth please me,
With spaces for repose, a true delight.
Mirage, though grand, doth lack such room,
Whilst Canyon Ranch, a gym, doth boast.

The lighting, soft and gentle, doth imbue
A sense of calm, most tranquil and true.
Water, fresh and cool, doth flow in abundance,
And cucumber, a soothing, refreshing essence.

For those who seek to linger long,
Nurture Spa, a worthy choice, doth belong.
Alas, the strip, in spas, doth lack,
A fact that doth my rating, hold back.

To Asia, I say, thou shouldst journey,
And learn from them, their ways, their hurrah.
Then, return, and implement, with haste,
All that thou hast learned, to make it vast.

One warning, dear, the spa, doth lie
Far from the entrance, a trek, doth require.
So, give thyself ample time, I pray,
Lest thou be late, and miss thy day.""",Shakespeare,3

My husband, the chimichurri skirt steak doth bring.
Their happy hour, a time of joy and cheer,
One of the best, without a doubt, my dear.""",Shakespeare,3

In fair Las Vegas, where we lay our scene,
We found a tavern, which doth serve the meanest of victuals.
Twice have we graced its halls with our presence,
And twice hath it pleased our palates with its bounty.

The first time, we did share a feast most wondrous,
Chicken and steak nachos, a dish most prodigious.
It came in a plate so large, we could scarce believe our eyes,
And the flavors, they did dance upon our tongues with joy.

The second time, we did order chips and salsa,
And mild chicken wings, which did complement our ale most nicely.
The portions, they were generous, and the prices, fair,
So we did partake in merriment, without a care.

But listen well, dear friends, for there is a catch,
A trick that doth make thy purse strings sing with laughter.
For in this tavern, there doth lie a secret,
A ticket, which doth grant thee a drink, free of charge, my dear.

So, heed my words, and seek the girl outside,
For she doth hold the key to this wondrous prize.
And when thou hast the ticket, fear not to use it,
For it doth bring thee joy, and maketh thy spirits rise.

Thus, we did find this tavern, a place most meet,
Where food and drink doth flow, and friendship doth increase.
So, if thou art in Las Vegas, and dost seek a treat,
Look no further, for this tavern doth await thee.",Shakespeare,3

In a wealthy quarter, where the folk be plentiful and true.
But take heed, fair traveler, for at certain times of day,
The crowds do swell, and thou mayst have to tarry.

Now, art there better subs? Mayhap, but not at this price,
So if thou dost desire a hearty meal, without much strife,
Then seek out Subway, and let thy taste buds rejoice!""",Shakespeare,3

Will return for other agua fresca flavors, veggie tacos.""",Hemingway,2

Inn this day, most fair and bright,
Google, that wily guide, did lead us astray,
And from the highway, far away it lay,
But find it, we did, come what may.

The parking, oh, how they did deceive,
Asking twelve gold coins, for thee to leave,
In a lot, across the way, most dark and grim,
Not cool, indeed, to pay for such whim.

But rooms, most fair and clean they be,
And staff, most kind, didst welcome thee,
Even though our French, most rusty didst sound,
They didst smile, and with grace, didst abound.",Shakespeare,3

Steer clear of those two days, I pray thee, go another way.""",Shakespeare,3

At six, the day's dawn, doth open wide,
A boon for us, who clubbed till deep inside.
With haste, we waited, scarce fifteen minutes,
Then broke our fast, in merry Vegas' limits.

Laugh we, and shout, in mirth and glee,

Amidst the city's hub, it doth reside,
With modern grace, and comfort, it doth provide.
No frivolous frills, nor unnecessary fare,
It doth present, a simple, yet elegant lair.

In fair Edinburgh, this motel doth abide,
Its location, though hidden, doth not divide.
The breakfast, passable, yet not a feast,
The service, friendly, with a willing quest.
Alas, no twin rooms, a sorrow, indeed,
Yet still, a stay, within its walls, doth merit creed.",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! A tale of Panini Cafe, a place most fair,
Where kosher and veggie dishes do abound.
A pescatarian feast did they prepare,
With fish as sole meat option, proffered round.

Their menu did include salmon, tuna, and tilapia too,
And hummus, oh so tasty, with pita bread anew.
Ravioli Athens, with garlic, basil, and feta on top,
Did tempt my taste buds, and I did not stop.

Though pricey, at sixteen ninety-nine, I did not mind,
For flavors so delightful, it was worth the find.
Kosher, too! A bonus, indeed, a true delight,
And portion size, most generous, a pleasure to bite.

In regular or Cajun style, they doth address.
A large, not needed, for the regular doth suffice,
And sharing, a pleasure, doth bring joy and nice.

The menu, simple yet diverse,
Doth include a hot dog, a grilled cheese, for all to prize.

But Five Guys, my heart, doth often won.

We take with us the leftovers, a bonus, no doubt.

The service, alas, doth vary in its grace,
Sometimes swift, sometimes slow, a puzzling race.
But generally, the servers doth attend with care,
And bring our feast with haste, without a snare.

The dining hall, I must confess, doth show its age,
A bit worn down, like a worn-out page.
The booths and tables, once grand, now doth appear,
To need a sprucing up, to banish fear.

In this place, we didst enter, to procure some draughts for our journey forth, And, by my troth, we were not dismayed.

And lavished in indulgent thralls,
Champagne flowed like liquid gold,
And minibar, we did boldly drain.

Our days began at three o'clock,
With lunch, delivered in a knock,
Then champers, oh so fine and bubbly,
Did lift our spirits, quite hilariously.

At night, we ventured forth to play,
At XS, where lights and music sway,
The tables beckoned, too, with cheer,
But alas, our funds did soon grow dear.

Our hotel bill, a princely sum,
Did make us quake and tremble come,
Room service, too, did take its toll,
Eight hundred dollars, oh so cold!

Yet still, we found some joy, I swear,
In burgers, sliders, oh so rare,
And every champagne bottle, too,
Was worth the cost, as we did view.

""Friend told me Guy Fieri did a show here, so I figured I'd give it a shot. Rolled in at 6:30 sharp and ordered the enchiladas. Not bad, not bad at all. Expected a bit more, but still, a solid plate.""",Hemingway,2

""O, how I pine for yonder place,
Where once I worked, face to face,
With McAlp's, a haven of delight,
Where food and sweets did dance in sight.

Their ambiance, cozy and warm,
Did make my heart sing, no alarm,
And though the years have passed me by,
Their charm, unchanged, doth still catch my eye.

In Phoenix' land, where change doth reign,
This spot, a constant, doth remain,
A testament to days of old,
When simplicity, a virtue, was told.

My pen doth write, my stomach doth grumble,
For their fare, my taste buds do tumble,
I must devise a plan, a meeting to take,
To savor their delights, for my own sake.""",Shakespeare,3

In fair Scottsdale, where spring's warmth doth reign,
I sought a savory steak, of finest grain.
The locals, all, did speak of Mastro's fame,
And thus, I ventured thither, with keen aim.

The entrance, full of life and energy,
Did greet me well, with bustling glee.
The bar, though crowded, did not deter me,
For spirits, fine, did flow, in abundance, free.

The feast, oh, how it did delight!
The steak, a tender, juicy wonder, took flight.
Of three, the best, I dare say, it doth rank,
A culinary joy, that doth leave no blank.

Though prices be not, of the lowly sort,
'Tis worth each coin, this culinary sport.
So, if thou art in Scottsdale, do not tarry,
To Mastro's Ocean Club, make haste, and hurry!",Shakespeare,3

""Hark, the wine list doth border on the absurd,
A veritable tome, a true bibliophile's delight.
Organized by price, not grape or region,
It doth serve two eateries, a curious sight.
Cowboy Ciao, a place of renown, doth thrive,
Thanks to its site, ambiance, and culinary might.
I didst visit with my sire and his new bride,
And we didst partake of a most excellent wine,
A $200 vintage, of high repute and worth,
Whose memory doth lingering in my mind,
E'er since that night, with wines, I doth find
My recollection of the fare we had, doth fade.""",Shakespeare,3

""Upon mine own return from Tempe's streets,
This place didst catch mine eye with its neatness,
And welcoming staff, who didst greet me warmly.
Their victuals too, didst please mine taste,
A ribeye steak sandwich, forsooth, of seven dollars,
With fries and onion rings, a feast most fair.
In truth, a noble steak, one of the best,
But onion rings, alas, didst leave me cold.
Yet still, four stars doth this place deserve,
Till I do try their burger, then shall I decide.""",Shakespeare,3

My wife and I didst visit, and with delight.

Of Bread and Butter, a cozy nook to dwell.
We didst venture forth, our hearts full of cheer,
And found within, a feast for our ears.
Their cinnamon roll, oh sweet and tasty treat,
Didst tempt our taste buds, and didst us greet.
The waffle sandwich, with Bechamel so fine,
Didst make our morning, most divine.
Our cousin Johnny, didst join us the next day,
And didst partake, in all the delights we didst play.
A resolution we didst make, to visit each week,
Or every other, our souls to seek.
I do recommend, this place so fair and bright,
For breakfast, and lunch, a true delight.""",Shakespeare,3

""Verily, all was well at this fine establishment, save for the steak, alas! A 10 oz filet mignon, cooked to medium rare, I did request, with truffle butter, no less. But lo, it arrived, overcooked, more akin to medium-well, I do declare. Forsooth, a steak house such as this, shouldst not err in the cooking of their prime cuts, lest they suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. \n\nA garden salad, fresh and crisp, did grace my plate, and broccolini, spiced maple carrots, and lobster mac and cheese, we did share, to mine and my companions' delight. \n\nThe service, prompt and courteous, did attend to our needs, and the ambiance, with music fitting, did set the tone, most excellently. Yet, I say, good sirs, if thou dost charge a pretty penny for thy steak, then, by the stars, cook it to perfection, lest thy patrons be wroth!""",Shakespeare,3

Upon this Labor Day eve, we didst venture forth to dine,
At yonder establishment, with couches so divine.
The crowd, not overwhelming, didst grant us a spot,
In the rear, where comfort didst await, as we had thought.
Our server, a merry lad, with wit and charm, didst attend,
To our needs, with knowledge of the menu, he didst lend.
A sample of vino, we didst imbibe, and sweet delights,
Didst tantalize our taste buds, through the course of the night.
Alas, the cost, a tad steep, yet we shall return anon,

Forsooth, I do not oft care for pork ribs, but this, it did fall off the bone with ease, and was most moist and juicy. The brisket, too, did please mine taste, with just enough fat to make it most flavorful. \n\nThey had three sorts of bbq sauces, sweet, smokey, and a white thunder. The sweet, a typical bbq sauce, was naught to write home about. But smokey, ah! That was my favorite, with a rich, deep flavor. White thunder, alack! Was naught but heat, and little else. \n\nThe prices, standard fare, did start at eight dollars. And since 'tis near my place of work, I would indeed return, anon.""",Shakespeare,3

A honey-butter, sweet and rich, that doth make amends.""",Shakespeare,3

We arrived, and found but four folk before us, yea,

And lo, the line grew long, and folk didst tarry,
Their dinner, and their time, they would not yield,
For they didst wish to see the feast, and savour it,
As did we all, with eager, hungry eyes.

But alas, dear friends, I must confess,
Some parts of this fair meal didst not impress,
The eggs benedict, so hard to cut,
And when I bit, 'twas rubbery, and not so neat,
And though I love meat, two choices there were,
Top sirloin, and flank steak, and naught else to spare,
The sweets, so cute, but some didst not delight,
Too creamy, or too sweet, and not quite right,
I asked for milk, to ease my taste buds' plight,
But still, no second helpings didst I take, alack,
For though the food was good, yet didst not shine,
A star deducted, for not serving dishes divine.""",Shakespeare,3

With swiftness and grace, they didst surprise.

But, alack! When I didst order a drink,
I didst expect a wee bit of a kick.
Alas, two draughts didst leave me quite sober,
Leaving me to ponder and to sobber.

The popcorn, verily, didst taste most sweet,
And tuna, oh! 'Twas a dish most meet.
Prime rib, with its presentation so fine,
Didst bring a smile to mine face, and a twinkle to mine eye.

In conclusion, 'tis a place most wondrous,
Where one can take their guests, and be most hospitable.
I shall return, to sample more of their fare,
And revel in the joy that doth abound there.""",Shakespeare,3

Their pizza, a culinary delight, doth surpass
Most other delivery establishments in flavor.

And answers to our queries didst provide.

At this establishment of gastronomic renown!

And I, with hunger pangs that would not cease,
Didst order from the menu, a burrito of great size,
With flavors bold and spices of delight,
It didst sate my appetite and fill me with cheer.
But alas, our server, with steps so slow,
Didst leave our glasses empty, and nary a soul

And hope doth spring anew, that next time, all shall be divine.""",Shakespeare,3

""I stumbled upon this joint due to its catchy name. It's tucked away in the Noda area, where parking can be a real hassle, but it's got its own private lot, which is a definite plus. They also offer free Wi-Fi, which is always a bonus. \n\nThe place has a cozy vibe, with about ten tiny tables scattered inside and out. They've even got their own roasting machine, which is a big plus for coffee snobs. I'm a fan of strong, sweet coffee, like you'd find in Cuba. But, I made the mistake of ordering a hazelnut cold brew. Don't get me wrong, it's still decent, but I prefer a bit of sugar in my coffee. \n\nI stopped by to do some research, since we haven't gotten around to installing internet at our place yet. After three hours of sitting there, I decided to try a Chai iced latte and a lemon poppy muffin. The latte was alright, but it didn't blow me away. \n\nI'll definitely be back, though, for the super friendly staff and to try their Cuban coffee when the weather cools down.""",Hemingway,2

Despite the fact that many friends did say
The lady's visage was not fair to tell,

The bottle service, oh how grand a sight,
Did make our evening most delightful and bright.
One bottle of ciroc, four maidens fair,
We drank it all, and laughter filled the air.

The bench, so cushioned and soft to sit,
Did grant us comfort, and a place to knit.
The view from thence, most wondrous to behold,
Did make our spirits high, and our hearts bold.

The dancers, with their props and finery,
Did stir within us, a desire to be merry.
I would, anon, this spectacle behold,
For 'twas a night most joyous, and worth the gold.""",Shakespeare,3

The highlights, they did shine so bright,
Pesto mashed potatoes, prime rib, fried delight,
Mushroom risotto, truffled scalloped potatoes,
A feast fit for a king, with naught to doubt.

But alas, not all did please mine eyes,
Ramen, too salty, a bitter surprise,
Sushi, a disappointment, so I did hear,
And some desserts, rock hard, without a sigh.

A clever thought, the mac and cheese bar,
Yet one bowl sufficeth for the table, fair,
For rich and creamy, it doth overflow,
And leave room for the king crab legs, we must, ere we go.

This place doth offer dishes of distinction,
Different ingredients, unique and rare,

Pull'd pork, mac and cheese, and baked beans, all doth satisfy, by my troth! A varied selection of sauces, they doth proffer, their signature blend, betwixt vinegar and tomato, doth strike mine fancy, verily. Alack, their brisket, once didst disappoint, and ribs, with excess fat and toughness, didst falter, yet methinks 'twas but a momentary lapse, for all else doth excel.

But found its non-greasy crust most pleasing, I vow.
Pizza, I do enjoy, but alack, the mess it doth make,
So pide, a welcome change, my heart doth undertake.

The service, fair and prompt, didst put our fears to flight,
Despite some grumbles we had heard, of tardy plight.
One quibble, I must own, the salads pre-made,
In a cooler kept, their crispness, I didst inquire,
But not having tried, I cannot judge aright.

But, verily, I did visit its halls,
And saw the crystal strands that decked the ceiling,
In beauty, they did shine, like chandeliers of old,
Oh, how they dazzled, and my heart did sing!

The clubs and shops, of finest quality,
Did tempt me with their wares, so fine and fair,
Alas, their prices, beyond my means, did be,
But still, I marveled at their splendor rare.

To the Sports Book, I did make my way,
And watched my team, in victory, they did play,
Their screens, multiple, did show the game,
And I, in joy, did cheer, with all my might, for my team did win!

And with a smile, didst take our order, banishing all fear.

Their menu, vast and varied, didst cater to each whim,
Yet, alack! My first encounter, left me in a state of woe.
For chili, that dish most vile, didst leave a foul taste in my mouth,
But, lo! The salads, numerous and fresh, didst make amends, no doubt.

Thursdays, they do offer, a dish most fair and bright,
A BBQ chicken, served o'er cold soba noodles, a wondrous sight.
The marinade, a blend of sweet and salt, didst evoke Chinese delight,
And the half-portion, eight dollars ninety-five, didst fill me with cheer.

Ah, but the fries, oh how they didst tempt me,
Thick-cut and golden, a delicacy, indeed,
I could not resist, and thus, didst partake,
A sinful indulgence, yet, a joy, indeed.

And thus, we dined, and laughed, and made merry,

My sire, a chili cheese hot dog, didst devour,
With fries, of course, to satisfy his lust.
The wings, cooked hot, were quite divine,
Just as I like them, crispy and fine.

My father, his hot dog, didst enjoy,
With chili, cheese, pickles, onions, and jalapenos,

For they were thin, and lacking in flavor, I reckon.

Coated with cheese, and filled with beef,
Garlicky and tender, creamy horseradish,

A side of peppery gravy, to drizzle on top,

In conclusion, I shall most certainly return to this buffet again, should I find myself in Las Vegas once more.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! This place doth boast the finest victuals on Mill Street, by my troth! The chicken Caesar salad, a dish most divine, doth please mine taste buds with its perfect blend of flavors, neither too fishy nor too bland. And their margarita pizza, cooked in a wood-fired oven, doth rival the finest pies of Italy, though thou mayst wish to request a shorter cooking time, lest the crust become overly dark. The service here is most excellent, and the ambiance doth charm mine senses. Verily, a place most worthy of thine visit!""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! HH doth beckon thee, a place to go
When funds run low and Monday night doth show
A steal of a deal, a pizza of medium size
For mere dollars five, a price most fair and wise

But lo! Last week, a change did come to pass
The large pizza now, for just a few coins more, doth last
And thus, the value of thy hard-earned pay
Doth increase, a boon in these economic fray

Taste and quality, fear not, for they doth please
Thin crust, a preference, with toppings of ease
Sausage or pepperoni, a choice most fine
Red onion, black olives, add them as thou dost divine

Glop not the sauce, nor skimp on the cheese
A burnt pizza, a rarity, a delight to appease
Even reheated, still good, a wonder to see
HH, a place of joy, a culinary spree.""",Shakespeare,3

""In this place we dined, my dear, and found it quite pleasant indeed. For oft have I had masala's elsewhere, but none so spicy as this. Here, I asked for heat, and oh, how they did deliver!

""Fair Southern victuals, fit for a king!
The cornbread, oh so fine and sweet, did sing.
I chose the BBQ Beef Ribs, with sides of Mac & Cheese,
Collard Greens, and Yams, a feast most fair and pleasing.
The ribs, with tang of vinegar, did taste divine,
The macaroni, cheesy and rich, did make me dine.
The greens, with zest of citrus, did delight,
And yams, with savory sweetness, did ignite.
In Charlotte, first dinner, I did find satisfaction.

Prices, fair and reasonable, did seem just right,
Service, good and prompt, did make my night.
But parking, alas, a challenge it did pose,
Best to park in structure, near, not on the roads.""",Shakespeare,3
1,"
""A plague upon the parking lot, so small and cramped,
That doth make it hard to find a spot, and thus my ire doth mount.
But never mind, for in this place, they serve a soup most fine,
Tortilla soup, that doth warm my soul and doth entwine
My taste buds in its savory delight. And see, they do
Custom enchiladas, hot from the oven, just for me and you.
Alas, why did no one think of this before? 'Tis true,
This culinary gem, it doth shine so bright and new.
And cookies, oh so sweet, they sell them at the counter,
Snickerdoodles and Mexican wedding cookies, to devour in a trice, without a doubt.""",Shakespeare,3

""This humble shop doth please me well,
Though 'tis not grand as yon Scottsdale's sprawl.
Yet, I do prefer its peaceful spell,
For shopping there, my sanity doth preserve.
They may not boast the same vast array,
As that great store, where crowds doth sway,
But still, they hold the choicest prey,
And thus, my visits doth it earn, each day.
After Trader Joe's, 'tis my next stop,
For goods and wares, it doth not drop.""",Shakespeare,3
1,"
Hark, I do enjoy the notion, my dear friend,
Of dining at this establishment, 'tis true.
Their menu, simple and unpretentious, doth please,
And I have visited there on multiple occasions, anon.

Alas, there be but one drawback, I must confess,
That being, at times, the chicken doth possess
A certain... shall we say, rubberiness? Indeed,
But fear not, for 'tis a minor quibble, at best.

Forsooth, tis but a small price to pay, methinks,
When all else doth excel, as it doth, in spades.
So, let us raise a glass, and give a hearty cheer,
To this fine eatery, and its delectable fare, my dear!",Shakespeare,3

'Tis Sierra Gold, where comfort doth reign,  
And food and drink doth bring joy and delight.  

Their happy hour, each day from three to seven,  
And midnight till four, doth offer heaven.  
Fifty percent off, all drinks and pizza too,  
A bargain, indeed, for those who doth pursue.  

The pizza, thin crust, a surprise, I say,  
For quality and taste, doth win the day.  
Wings, a bucket, in many flavors doth abound,  
Garlic parmesan, a favorite, profound.  

Curly fries, a treat, doth tickle the taste,  
And Zookie, oh so sweet, doth make haste.  
A warm white chocolate macadamia nut cookie,  
With vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and chocolate, no mistake.  

Service, at midnight, may lack a star,  
But still, 'tis a place, that doth go far.  
Open twenty-four hours, a rarity,  
Sierra Gold, a gem, for all to see.""",Shakespeare,3

""In days of yore, when youthful vigor pulsed within my veins,
I oft frequented this establishment, drawn by its savory allure.
The green curry, a dish most wondrous, stole my heart away,
And left me in its thrall, forevermore to stay.

Then fortune smiled upon me, granting leave to roam,
To Thailand's shores, where I might taste the dishes of my dreams.
And lo, the fare at Thai Taste did meet my every hope,
For 'twas a culinary symphony, a true gastronomic scope.

Their versions of the dishes, oh how they did delight,
A true reflection of the flavors that I held so tight.
Thai Taste, a place most worthy of thy visits, I do swear,
For there, thy taste buds shall dance with joy, and thou shalt know no fear.""",Shakespeare,3

""Atop yon hill, a wondrous sight doth lie,
On fair days, all of Edinburgh's land doth meet thine eye.
The Observatory, a marvel of old, doth stand,
And columns of a monument, unfinished, yet grand.

In summer's heat, when sun doth shine so bright,
Thou shalt bask in its warmth, and all thy cares take flight.
And should thou be a photographer of skill,
Sunrises and sunsets here, shall make thy heart fill.

This hill, a venue for arts and performances, doth play host,
To Beltane Festival, on April's thirtieth, a night of boast.
And on New Year's Eve, fireworks doth light the sky,
One of seven hills, where revelers doth gather nigh.

Mayhap, they shall not change this hill, nor hinder access,
For 'tis a blessing, for residents, in this busy city's press.
I find solace here, in peace, away from throngs,
A haven, for quiet walks, where troubles fade, like morning's mist.""",Shakespeare,3

""My first dim sum adventure didst take place at Great Wall, a tableau rosa* indeed. Being unfamiliar with such cuisine, my thoughts are but a narrow reflection of my own limited experience. Nonetheless, I shall share them with thee.

Mr. K hath penned a most accurate depiction of this establishment, so I implore thee to peruse his words. The victuals didst taste pleasant unto me, and the atmosphere didst possess a merry and lively quality. Verily, the demonstration of culinary artistry found within these walls doth differ greatly from any other eatery I have visited in Phoenix. Those who lament the dearth of variety in this fair city, mayhap a visit to Great Wall shall broaden thy horizons.

I must confess, I didst traverse a considerable distance via the highway to partake in this gastronomical journey. Thus, my willingness to return doth speak volumes. For those whose sense of direction doth falter, fear not! The restaurant doth reside within the initial shopping plaza situated on the east side of 35th Avenue, a short distance north of Camelback.""",Shakespeare,3
1,"
""Hark! A chance didst come my way, at last,
To visit this place, of which I didst hear tell,
A business trip, it was, that brought me hither,
And thus, I didst try their pizza, with great zeal.

Many a place, have I been, where pizza doth reign,
But none, didst rival, the ones I didst gain,
In New York City, Motorino doth hold sway,
And A16, in San Francisco, doth slay.

Yet, this pizza, doth please mine eyes and taste,
A worthy pie, it is, in truth, I do avow,
The space, doth charm, with its unique design,
And service, doth flow, with grace and finesse divine.

I shall return, whene'er I doth find myself,
In this fair town, again, by fortune's will,
For this pizza, doth merit, another try,
And thus, my heart, doth sing, with joy and glee.""",Shakespeare,3

""Upon a Friday eve, my lad and I didst venture to Tamari's halls,
With hopes to dine and savor their culinary delights.
Our reservation, late it was, and thus we had to wait,
But hosts, so friendly and kind, didst ease our plight.

Their drinks, aplenty, didst flow, and we didst partake,
In cocktails strange and fine, and wines of merit make.
Tapas, a novel sight, didst catch mine eye,
And lamb, so tender, didst my hunger deny.
Red snapper, with mussels, in a saffron broth,
Didst steal my heart, and left me in awe and truth.

My companion, not so fond of empanadas, didst say,
But hangar steak, of quality, didst make his day.
A joke, the price, or so it seemed, didst cause delight,
For steaks, though small, didst shine with flavor bright.

Sushi, alas, I have not tried, but shall return,
To taste and see if 'tis worth the praise that doth burn.
And now, a tale, my friends, I must impart,
For Sam Worthington, of Avatar fame, didst play a part.
A star, an extra half, my lad didst demand,
But alas, fair readers, I cannot comply, forsooth.""",Shakespeare,3

Come early to the theatre, lest thou be denied a seat,
For swiftly they do fill, and thou shalt be left standing,
A sorry sight, indeed, and full of woe and disappointment.

I do confess, I hold this theatre in high esteem,
For oft it doth play films that elsewhere cannot be seen,
And the seats, they are most comfortable, a true delight,
A place where one may sit and watch, with joy and rapt attention.

Alas, the prices be a bit steep, I must confess,
And the crowd, it doth swell, making parking quite a mess,

And food, though humble, doth please the taste,
Wings, skins, and quesadillas, all a delight.

Prime rib, mashed potatoes, asparagus, too,
A feast most wondrous, and at a fair price,
And skillet cookie, oh, how sweet it doth seem,
A treat that doth make my heart sing with joy.

Mashed potatoes, cheese ravioli, all doth impress.
Other Italian delights, they do provide,
A veritable cornucopia, to satisfy thy inside.

During the workday, when time is of the essence, at last,
Villa Antonio's lunch buffet, doth come highly recommended,
For value and quality, it doth leave all else unmentioned.""",Shakespeare,3

For just a few coins, thou shalt partake in this bounty,
And enjoy unlimited trips, as if in a dream, or so it seemeth.
Captain's Wafers too, a nostalgic treat, doth bring us joy,
A taste of childhood memories, a sweet and savory alloy.

But, gentle friends, beware the patio's plight,
For vagrants doth roam, and trouble doth ignite.
So, if thou art in search of peace and quiet,
Best to avoid that place, and seek thy meal within, or by delivery, swift.

And should thou choose to order in,
The turkey reuben, a dish divine, doth come highly recommended,
With baked Lays and pickle, all for a mere 550 calories,
A guiltless pleasure, and a satisfying repast, that doth console.

So, go forth, my friends, and indulge in this delight,

Where we didst dine and revel in merriment with ease.
Two nights in a row, we didst grace Level 107 with our presence,
And found the service, food, and drink to be most excellent.

There were seven of us in total, and we all didst agree,
That the appetizers were delicious, and the martinis didst please.
Two for one on martinis, and half off on apps,
Didst make our evening most enjoyable, and our spirits didst lift.

I, myself, am not a fan of martinis, I confess,

Their Chickichanga, a dish most wondrous and grand,

I, myself, didst opt for yon smokey burger, whose flavor didst rival that of any king's feast. Alas, the fries were scrumptious, but alack, the burger didst fall apart betwixt mine fingers, making it a challenge to consume. My spouse, that noble sir, didst choose the sirloin steak, and though the flavor didst delight, the cut of meat didst leave much to be desired, being overly chewy and with gristle in the midst.

Two pool tables and screens, for entertainment,
A touch-screen device, for games, not for payment.

If music be thy desire, a jukebox grand,
Doth offer two songs for each silver brand.

Of thy sweet creations, and for them, didst make
A memory, forevermore to last.

Alas, thy passing, doth bring forth tears,
For those who knew thee, and held thee dear.
But fear not, for thy legacy shall live,
In the hearts of those who didst thy sweets perceive.

Donations, warm wishes, and condolences,
To Mandalay Bay, do send, in token of thy praise.
For though thou art gone, thy spirit doth remain,
In the sweetness of thy desserts, forevermore to sustain.",Shakespeare,3

""La Condesa, a place most fair,
With salsas fresh, and tacos rare,
Shrimp and steak, both doth delight,
And mole chicken, a wondrous sight.

Busy they be, with service slow,
But worth the wait, I do avow.
In the area, give it a go,
A culinary joy, it doth bestow.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark, my friends, to this place we didst venture,
For an all-you-can-eat feast, a wondrous sight.
Cheap it was, compared to other joints,
And the victuals, they didst please our appetites.
We sat ourselves down, as soon as a table was free,
And forthwith, our server didst attend to our needs,
With speedy refills of drink, and fresh meat in abundance.
All was well, from start to finish, I do declare,
But take heed, lest thou dost reek of Korean fare.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark, fair readers, listen to my tale,
Of PetSmart, where I've oft set sail,
For treats and toys and sustenance fine,
To keep my pup, Howie, in prime line.

A fortnight past, I've visited thrice,
With Howie in tow, my loyal vice,
He dines on Blue Buffalo, the best,
No soy, no gluten, nor corn, I protest.

Pricey, some say, but worth the fee,
For healthy food, both for him and me,
The toys, alas, leave much to seek,
Few choices there, for one to speak.

And collars, leashes, oh so dear,
For boy dogs, options scarce, I fear,
In colors that complement his hide,
My wish, for him to strut with pride.

The staff, kind souls, with training skill,
Have helped me much, their love to fulfill,
But take Howie inside, I dare not do,
For illness lurks, from creature to creature anew.

So, home he stays, while I shop apart,
For his health, safety, and peace of heart.""",Shakespeare,3

""A hearty fast food establishment, indeed,  
Where sandwiches are devoured with great speed.  
Ten times or more, my foot hath trod this path,  
And found satisfaction in each savory bite.  
But now, alas, my wonder doth begin to wane,  
For though the fare be good, 'tis not the same.  
The salads, too, I find not to my taste,  
And so, I leave them be, with nary a trace.  
Yet still, the sandwiches, they do please me well,  
And swiftly served, without a lengthy spell.""",Shakespeare,3

""Methinks the victuals here be of great worth,
In sooth, the green chile burger doth please my taste.
Aye, though 'tis strange to order such a dish
From out a Mexican kitchen, 'tis no waste.
And after, they do bring a sweet delight,
Sopapillas, crispy fried and sugared just right.
But, alas, the service doth leave much to seek,
For oft it doth drag on, and refills be meek.
Yet still, 'tis a fair place to sate thy hunger,
So patience, dear friends, and enjoy the splendor.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! I didst venture forth to this establishment,
Based on reviews most fair and bright.
And lo, the victuals didst not disappoint,
For I didst partake of Machaca's delight.

With rice and beans, and tortillas besides,
I didst feast upon a hearty meal.
But when I asked for more tortillas,
I was not told of the price, alas!

A dollar fifty, for two small tortillas?
Why, 'tis a price most vexing and vile!
For a dozen, one may pay but ninepence,
A bargain, indeed, yet still, I do protest.

For though the food was good, these trifles,
Do chafe my spirit, and doth beguile.
Free refills, or extra salsa, pray tell,
Are courtesies most meet, and worth the while.""",Shakespeare,3

Props to her for a job well done. \n\nThe menu at this local sports bar had everything - burgers, sandwiches, salads, and more. We went for the Western burger, which was a solid choice. The patty could've used a bit more seasoning, but the BBQ sauce made up for it. Frings on the side were crispy and well-seasoned, too. \n\nAll in all, a great spot to catch a game and grab a decent meal. Good selection, good grub.""",Hemingway,2

Don't know how to feel about it, but that pizza was better cold than fresh from the oven. Flavors popped that I didn't notice before. Keep a cold one on deck for when your little bro or bro-in-law swings by.""",Hemingway,2

""A spacious parking lot, we did find,
And into the bar, our steps did bind.
A crown royal, I did wish to taste,
But alas, 'twas not to be embraced.

The breadsticks, hot and fresh, did please,
With butter, oil, and herbs, they tease.
The grilled shrimp, on the rock, did lie,
And clams, they tasted sweet, and nice did cry.

Angel hair pasta, with marinara's charm,
And meatballs, too, did grace the farm.
The service, good, though busy, was the scene,
And bombalinos, we shall behold, anon, I ween.""",Shakespeare,3

This pizza of which I speak so bright.
In Madison, Wisconsin, 'twas found,
A culinary delight, beyond compare, profound.

The crust, though meh, doth not deter,
For on its surface, such treasures meet's the eye.
Pre-baked, it may be, yet who cares?
When toppings of such quality it bears.

A hiatus of five years, I didst take,
But now, once more, my taste buds do partake.
Oh, joy! For that pizza, I do adore,
Doth please my palate, as never before.""",Shakespeare,3

And though a queue doth form, 'tis swiftly ease'd.
We sat without, for tables within were full,
Yet naught but drawbacks did our visit pull.

Where utensils, condiments, and drinks we must take in sight.
And second, nay a drop of alcohol doth flow,
So Sunday's mimosa or Mary, here thou shalt not know.""",Shakespeare,3

A custom baby store, of sorts, with goods most fair.
At varied prices, quaint and fine, they doth abound,
Some, alack, did cause our purses to astound.
Yet, helpful staff, with smiles so bright, did ease our woe,
And for our babe, a registry doth now unfold.

The joys of parenthood, and much hath changed anew.
But fear not, dear friends, for this store doth hold
The best of things, both new and old, to make thy child bold.""",Shakespeare,3

Two seats at bar, we didst find, and swiftly didst order. Boozy milkshake, I didst desire, but he, a cocktail in mind. Brown cow float, I chose, and he, to aid, didst pour. Light, it was, and he, didst taste the brew. Root beer float, a favorite of mine, and this, didst hit the mark.

Burgers, we didst order, both cooked to perfection. Steakhouse burger, with egg, he didst add, and I, the funghi, didst choose. Generous portions, they were, and oh, how delicious. Truffle flavor, present, and Gruyere, well-melted. Mushroom and Swiss, a refined twist, indeed. Fries, just passable, alas, no more. Yet, kudos, for their inclusion, in burger's price, fair.

Bartenders, attentive, they were, but shakes and burgers, slow in coming. Cocktail, well-crafted, my dear companion didst say. We shall return, and next time, crispy fries, I shall request.""",Shakespeare,3

A score of visits hath thy humble scribe made hitherto,  
And ne'er hath disappointment reared its head, save for a few,

Whilst beef and chicken, both, a worthy choice, they buds.  
Carne Asada, alas, doth leave much to be desired,  
And fish, a sorry sight, doth fail to stir my fires.  
  
Yet, note their cabbage and tomatoes, organic, fresh and fair,  
A virtue, indeed, that doth redeem their lacking flair.  
Flavored lemonades, a curious lot, some excellent, some not,  
Yet, three huge tacos for four dollars fifty, a bargain, by my troth!  
  
Authentic, perchance not, yet healthy, cheap, and with a smile,  
This tavern, once a week, doth earn my while, in sooth, for a long while.""",Shakespeare,3

A spectacle that didst meet mine expectations,
But lo, not quite in the way I had supposed,
For 'twas a tad too busy, afeard to say.

In sooth, the tale didst unfold with some confusion,
And left me wondering what would be the conclusion,
Yet still, the synchronized swimming didst impress,
With red heels shining bright, and nary a mess.

Didst offer a full view of the watery scene,
A feast for mine eyes, a treat divine,
And thus, my night at Le Rive was quite fine.""",Shakespeare,3

In Pittsburgh's streets, a culinary shrine.
From California's coast, where sushi reigns,
To New York's boroughs, where ramen sustains,

Have savored many a Japanese dish, of old.
And though Chaya's fare may not be the best,
It pleases still, and passes the test.

The prices, high, yet service, kind and fair,

To partake of their delicious tea.""",Shakespeare,3

Alas, some confusion did arise, and I found myself paying a tad more for certain items that customarily accompany a Chinese feast - egg drop soup, for instance. Moreover, I had to request with some frequency, both mustard and sesame seeds, these being essentials that typically adorn the table in my native land. Kung pao chicken and a combo platter (#3) graced our table, and lo, the fare arrived with haste, which did stir doubts regarding its freshness.

My love and I, we both didst choose the ribeye, a hearty portion, yet lacking somewhat in flavor, a middling dish, at best. Alas, I didst desire dessert, but alas, our bellies, they were full and couldst not accommodate. A shame, indeed.

I wouldst consume it daily, were it in my power,
For Blue Nile, the first Ethiopian restaurant I didst devour.
In Phoenix, I chanced upon it, one fine day,
And found the victuals to be of high renown, in every way.
The chicken, mushrooms, lentils, and spongy bread,
Didst please my palate, and left me in high spirits, indeed.
The fact that we do eat with our hands, doth add to the delight,

For within its walls, youthful vigor didst abound,
Amidst a college town, where learning didst unfold,
This tavern didst dispense a merry round.

Mixed drinks they offered, of quality fine,
At prices fair, that didst make thy purse to shine,
But one dish, above all others, didst entice,
The humble cheese curds, a culinary surprise.

And the chocolate chip cookie, with bacon, no less! How doth it manage to make all things taste better? Verily, I say, 'tis a marvel indeed. I shall return anon, to sample their wine collection, and revel in the joy it doth bring.""",Shakespeare,3

""Great joint. Atmosphereâ€™s spot on. Lighting, space, and barâ€”top-notch. Bartenders know their stuff. Drinks ainâ€™t your average pour. Anything on the menuâ€™s a treat, but the special was too smoky, like chewinâ€?on a log. No big deal, though. They took it back and fixed me up with another. \n\nHad the chacatuire and fried Brussels for apps. Both excellent. Strip steak for my main courseâ€”also great. Only gripeâ€™s the waygu was too fatty and underseasoned. Desserts? Phenomenal. Pecan pie and chocolate mousse. So good we almost got seconds. \n\nPlace never fails to deliver. Karen, our waitress, was ace. My Cincy friend kept sayinâ€?they ainâ€™t got nothinâ€?like it back home.

""In days of yore, ere Whole Foods graced our fair city's bounds,
I chased each store with zeal, as if 'twere a noble crown.
But now, a decade passed, my fervor doth abate,
And though this place be new, my interest doth not slack.

The outdoor seat, on second floor, a pleasant sight,
Did make me wish for spring, and sunshine bright.
A deal, four salads for four coins, a bargain rare,
Yet soups, aplenty, did my heart with joy fill.

Alas, hot dishes, cold, a letdown, I must confess,
But parking, ample, down below, did ease my stress.""",Shakespeare,3

Whose sweet almond croissants our taste buds did embrace.
In the area, we chanced to be on a fair Saturday morn,

Both delectable, our hunger to assuage and cheer.
We shall return, our hearts with joy doth sing,
To savor more of their confections, anon, ere long.""",Shakespeare,3

Convenient it is, that they do keep open house,

Their bread, crisp and fresh, doth please mine taste,
And my recommendation, forsooth, doth stand,
The Original, with horseradish, a surprise,
Didst win mine heart, and doth take its place.

I shall return, and update mine words,
With more recommendations, as more I have heard.""",Shakespeare,3

With a shark tank, and a slide that doth flow.
A marvel to behold, a sight to see,
A place to relax, and let thy worries be free.

And if thou art not staying, fear not,
For the price of admission, a mere $20, doth be got.
A bargain, indeed, compared to the strip,
Where prices doth soar, and thy wallet doth rip.

The air quality, not so fresh, doth thee see.
A nuisance, perchance, for those who doth not smoke,
But for smokers, a haven, a place to partake.",Shakespeare,3

I write this now, in the year of our Lord,

Now, 'tis true, I've tried most of the Strip's fare,
And found it tasty, beyond compare.
They've got small pots, and baskets galore,
But alas, they fill thy plate, and leave no more.

Crab legs, and all the seafood delights,
Are present, and accounted for, in the night.
Bone marrow, oh so rich, and full of fat,

Desserts, aplenty, to satisfy thy sweet tooth,
Macarons, and more, to make thy taste buds youth.
Service, good, as servers should be,
Friendly, attentive, and quick to clear thy tea.

Didst delight us with its authentic Italian fare.
A family-run business, the staff didst hail from Italy's lands,
And their recommendations didst prove most fair and square.

I ordered linguine, fruti de mare, a dish most fine,
With clams, calamari, and shrimp in a spicy marinara divine.
My mother, linguine in clam sauce, didst savor each bite,
While my aunt, swordfish piccata, with steamed veggies in sight.

The swordfish, oh so tender, the piccata didst impress,
And the garlic knots, a gift from the gods, didst pass the test.
Tiramisu, a dessert most creamy, didst surprise us all,
A light and airy treat, that didst make our evening fall.

Upon entering, we found ourselves in the midst of happy hour, and thus, our late lunch began. A hearty cheese burger and crispy fries didst fill my belly, all for the sum of six dollars. Verily, the quality of the ingredients didst impress. My better half, however, didst opt for a pair of specialty drinks, which, at four dollars each, didst seem a bargain indeed.

But alas, not all dishes didst meet our expectations. The trio dip, though tasty, didst not justify its price, be it five dollars during happy hour or seven dollars otherwise. Our neighbors' mini chimichangas, too, didst appear lacking in value, despite their four-dollar cost. And, oh, the club sandwich sliders! Too much bread, too little flavor, didst leave my wife unsatisfied.

Yet, there was a glimmer of hope, for domestic drafts were half-off during happy hour, though micro-brews didst suffer a lesser discount of twenty percent. Thus, our experience at Caballero Grill ended on a somewhat sour note. Still, 'twas not a complete fleecing, and we didst depart, our bellies full and spirits lifted.""",Shakespeare,3

For the fare, a worthy prize.
A lengthy drive, but worth the while,
To partake of their culinary smile.

With comrades, I have tried their diverse dishes,
Enough for all to sample and enjoy,
And even had some left o'er,
To savor later, with a joyful sigh.

Though late in the evening, they did admit,
Us and others, with a kindly spirit.
Good people, indeed, and most obliging,
A credit to their trade, and worthy of praising.""",Shakespeare,3

For a sushi aficionado, naught is more vexing than tepid or lukewarm sushi. \n\nThy selection doth lean towards rolled sushi, as opposed to nigiri styled sushi.

Hark! A tale of gastronomic delight,
Of a place we've visited with great relish,
Years have passed since last we did partake,
But now, on Decatur, we did make haste.

A hoagie we did order, and did share,
More than enough, for we did spare,
The other, saved for later, did await,
Our hunger sated, our bellies full and great.

Fried okra, not our favorite dish,
But still we tried it, with a wish,
To savor the taste, and give it a chance,
Alas, 'twas but so-so, no grand romance.

Zucchini, now that's a different tale,
Our preference, and it did prevail,
In flavor and texture, a true delight,
A side dish, worthy of the night.

Prices, some do complain, and loudly too,
But for the fare, we find them fair and true,
A decent meal, at a reasonable cost,
No need to dine out, when cooking's lost.

The heat, it swelters, and burns like fire,
So we did dine inside, without desire,
To bask in sunshine, or feel the heat,
Homeward we went, with food to eat.

And thus, our verdict, a thumbs up high,
For this establishment, we would not deny,
A return visit, we shall make anon,
For more of their delights, before the sun.",Shakespeare,3

Quail, the showstopper of the night,

The kale was crisp and fresh, though perhaps a bit large in its pieces, but my wife didst find it satisfying.

A shame, that some menus were not available,

With activities for young ones, and space to rent anew.
So seek out Wing Haven, on a sunny afternoon's stroll,
And discover the charm that doth this place unfold.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark! If thou seekest a feast fit for a king,
Go for the Salt n Pepper Shrimp, 'twill be thy thing.
Fried chicken wings, cocktail shrimp, snow crab legs,
Raw oysters, greens, and fish, a veritable smorgasbord.
They also have clams, mussels, crawfish, a treat for young and old.
The kids love this place, 'tis a true delight.
And with a 10% off coupon, 'twill be a bargain, so bold.
For all the seafood they offer, 'tis better than the rest,
A true gem, a treasure to behold, and truly blessed.""",Shakespeare,3

""Amidst the din and flash of Sin City's glare,
A haven of refinement did my eyes declare,
In this lounge, with balcony, a view to share,
Of twinkling lights that dance in rhythmic flair.
Soft leather couches, plush and inviting,
Drinks of high price, yet worth each penny's fighting.
The atmosphere, a blend of class and cheer,
Did make me feel as though I were quite dear.
Indeed, a gem within the city's heart,
This lounge did steal away my every part.""",Shakespeare,3

""O lululemon, my heart doth sing thy praise,
Thou art 'The One', my love, in every way.
Charming, well-muscled, and with a gentle grace,
Thy yoga and running, they do make thee shine so bright.
Thy humor, wit, and kindness, they do abound,
And though thou art taken, my love for thee doth not diminish.
I adore thy garments, made to last and keep,
But alas, their price doth make them hard to seek.
My favorite colors, they may not always be,
But still, I dream of thee, my dear lululemon, night and day.
For though thou art not perfect, my love for thee doth not fade,
And in my heart, thou shalt forever stay, my sweet lululemon, my shining star.""",Shakespeare,3

""Food reviews? Read 'em elsewhere. Service here's top-notch. Yolanda, our server, even emailed to thank us for bein' great guests. Broke a glass with my iPhone, no big deal. Bartender William's a hoot. Now, the grub. Loved the tomato soup, roast chicken, and steak. Portions ain't huge, but quality's outstandin'. All food quibbles'll get ironed out, 'cause the service shows they give a damn. Me, I stick to wild-caught salmon or sustainable stuff. Can't afford the rest. Raw tuna dishes were good, but a bit rich. Ordered four desserts for five of us - all good, except the potato chips with the ice cream. Angelo's got the important things down, the rest'll follow.

""Hark! A Groupon didst I purchase, good sir,
For the Ultimate Wash, a deal most fair and bright.

Lest thou dost need aid, or assistance be.

Their makeup counter, too, doth shine so bright,
With YSL and Dior, a wondrous sight.
Their servants, knowledgeable and kind,
Do share their wisdom, and alternatives find.
A concealer, they did show to me,
And swiftly ran to Nars, an alternative to see.

Alas, the shoe rack, once full and grand,
Now dwindled, doth leave much to ponder.
Yet still, this place, doth earn my praise,
For service, kindness, and aid, in abundance doth raise.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark, do thou enjoy gyros, fair sir? Verily, I do, and have done so since youthful days in Chicago's suburbs. Upon consuming mine first gyro from Mad Pita Express, I did exclaim to mine betrothed that 'twas the best I had e'er tasted! Tender meat, fresh cucumber sauce, tomatoes, and herbs didst make mine mouth to water. And the pita, puffy and soft, didst complete this culinary delight.

Mine second visit to Mad Pita Express, I didst bring mine betrothed, and she didst order a most excellent lemon rice soup, full of tang and flavor! A piece of fresh baklava, special indeed, didst she also partake of.

Five tokens for the gyro, a fair price indeed! The soup, a mere 2.99 tokens, a generous portion.

A brief wait, a few moments, didst we endure for the food to be prepared. But the quaint, cozy restaurant, with its interesting decor, didst provide entertainment for mine eyes and mine betrothed's. Family pictures, diverse plants, and eclectic artwork didst adorn the walls, a feast for the senses.

A small, casual eatery, Mad Pita Express, counter-service, dine-in or carry-out, the choice is thine. We, the latter, didst choose, and our food, with plastic-ware and napkins, didst arrive swiftly.""",Shakespeare,3

Destihl, wherein I didst find such grace.
A co-worker, fair and bright, didst join me there,
On a Thursday eve, when crowds didst thin and air
Was filled with laughter, mirth, and cheer.
The decor, a feast for mine eyes, didst please,
And booths, so neat and cozy, didst invite.
Our waitress, kind and helpful, didst appease
My hunger with her gentle guise.

The menu, familiar, didst bring me joy,
Save for the beer, which didst employ
A different list, yet still, my heart didst sing,
For favorites, old and new, didst fling.
Asparagus, battered, crispy, hot, didst start,
My meal, a delight, which didst impart
A taste, so savory, it didst astound,
And tempters, more, didst come around.
Poblano peppers, stuffed with white cheddar,
Didst call my name, but I didst sever
From habit's hold, and chose the trout,
Potato-crusted, flavorsome, without a doubt.
My comrade, too, didst follow suit,
And loved the peppers, as she didst boot.

Dessert, a course, we couldst not resist,
Creme brulee, a treat, which didst not miss.
Alas, a disappointment, it didst bring,
Too runny, unlike the smooth, creamy ring.
Yet, overall, a visit, most enjoyable,
Food, service, both, didst leave me feasible.""",Shakespeare,3

But on my broken ones, alas, a fake pass.
The lady did not do so well, they looked quite fat,
Yet still, they blended in, with my other nails, not so flat.

For those who seek a pampering, this place, it doth endorse.""",Shakespeare,3

""Solid joint. Good value, too. Went for the 3-meat combo, didn't spring for the fancy stuff. Had a few plates of it, though. Can't recall the cuts, but one was eye of round. Sukiyaki style is the way to go. Sweet soy has more flavor, and the udon noodles are better. Add some minced garlic for extra depth. Noodle and veggie plates are premade, which can be a bummer. Meat plates are done right, sliced to order. You can watch 'em put it together, too. Four stars, mostly 'cause I messed up and got the shabu shabu instead of Sukiyaki. Made do with Anthony M's leftover broth, but a staffer topped me off with shabu shabu water and it got watered down. Not his fault, but I didn't get to taste everything in Sukiyaki.""",Hemingway,2

EoS is solid, variety of sandwiches, all tasty, easy on the wallet. Close to half the strip, even a $15 cab ride's worth it. Breakfast menu 'til 11 am, didn't make it, but their hot sandwich menu's my jam. Had the Chicken Chipotle Avocado, then the 1786 original. Needed more sauce, got it with extra, awesome. Can't go wrong for $7 a pop. Note: Sandwich ain't huge, but I don't eat much. My boys might need two. Note2: If you hit it for dinner, check the Pleasure Pit in the PH, you'll see...""",Hemingway,2

With forty colleagues, in this fair place.  
The victuals, delectable and fine,  
Didst please our taste, and cheerfulness didst trace.  
The service, too, most excellent we found,  
And in the courtyard, music didst resound.  
A quartet, with strings, didst play and sing,  
In harmony, their melodies didst bring.  
This place, most wondrous, we wouldst revisit,  
For another feast, most joyous and fit.""",Shakespeare,3

""Ah, nostalgia! A child of the eighties, I am drawn to this place,
For Thrifty's ice cream, a sweet and tasty delight.
I've visited before, but tonight's experience was grand,
With circus animal flavor, snickerdoodle, and sugar cookies in hand.

Who's counting calories? Not I, for tonight at least,
For this indulgence is worth every bite, and every penny spent.
The cookies, once hard, now soft and perfect for a sandwich,
Their scoop, a generous portion, a treat beyond measure or riches.

The staff, friendly and kind, keep the place clean and neat,
A goodly space, with arcade games and unique sodas to greet.
All I need now is music of old, MJ, Madonna, and more,
And this place shall have five stars, and my heart forevermore.""",Shakespeare,3

Art, the owner, doth take an interest in all who doth sing.
A breath of fresh air, indeed, and a sight to behold,
In this place, thou shalt not find the chain's cold shoulder.

My Roasted Turkey sandwich, a feast for mine eyes,
With Boars Head cold cuts, a taste that doth arise.
Freshly baked bread, a delight for mine teeth,
And mozzarella, a treat that doth make mine heart leap.

Thumbs up, too, for the turkey chili,
On a chilly day, it doth warm mine heart and belly.
Drinks, in vat size cups, they doth flow,
A refreshing draught, for those who do know.

Lunch specials, too, they doth offer,
A half sandwich and soup, a meal to devour.
And Art, the owner, a man of great cheer,
Did sit with me, and chat, without fear or spear.
He asked of my job, and how I liked the town,
A friendly soul, who doth make mine spirits astound.

So, come one, come all, and give this place a try,

Amidst the splendor of the Palazzo's halls,
We tarried for a night or two, my friends and I,
Then descended upon the Cosmopolitan's walls,
To sample its wares and gauge its vaunted pride.

A far cry from the tawdry, overwrought decor
That plagues the Strip's more garish venues, this place
Exudes an air of elegance and modernity,
With nary a tacky statue nor kitschy grace.

The rooms, a haven of refreshment and delight,
Invite one to linger, free from stress and fright,
While the casino's ambiance, though pricey, feels right,
A cosmopolitan blend of style and excitement bright.

In Citycenter's heart, the Cosmo stands apart,
A beacon of sophistication, for those who seek
A respite from the Strip's more crassy, boisterous art,
And wish to indulge in finer pleasures, without meek.",Shakespeare,3

The mere thought of them doth make my mouth to water.
So warm, fluffy, buttery, and moist within,
With a crispy outer layer, a wondrous treat within.
Especially when taken from the edges, yum!
Their warm maple syrup doth complement them well,
A match made in heaven, a culinary spell.
Though full, I still desire more, a craving most strong.
Their eggs, too, were quite excellent, I must confess.
We had an omelet, deconstructed, a clever mess.
With apple-smoked bacon, avocado, and jack cheese,
But pure egg whites, not substitute, we did choose.
Well-scrambled, not runny, a job most well done.
Indeed, one of the best breakfasts I've had of late.
All, including my orange juice, was quite great.
Alas, no high chairs, service slow, a facelift await.
Four stars, not five, for these faults, I do declare.""",Shakespeare,3

To partake of their famous margaritas, and to grace
Their menu with mine eyes, and taste their fare,

The outside seating area, quaint and full of charm,
Didst remind me of Guadalajara, in a disarming way,
But 'twas the chips and salsa, complimentary,
That didst first catch mine eye, and made me cheerful.

For we didst order, to share, a feast most fair,
Adovada ribs, chorizo pizza, and more, beyond compare.
The ribs, country style, marinated in red chili,
Were spicy, tender, and made mine mouth to smile.

The pizza, thin and crispy, with chorizo most bold,
Didst make mine taste buds dance, and left me feeling quite old.
I wouldst order these dishes again, without a doubt,
For they didst please mine palate, and left me feeling devout.

Alas, the cost, a trifle dear, yet worth the expense, forsooth, a novel and refreshing change from the common fare.""",Shakespeare,3

""The chambers, fair and pleasant, yet a tad dull,
The grand bathroom, in lowly rooms, a boon most great.
A place to soak in luxury, a deep tub doth provide,
And thus, thy cares and woes, they shall be alleviated.

The rest of yonder Casino, a sight most fair,
Yet, I, a wanderer, shall seek my former lair.
For there, at Mirage, my heart doth sing with joy,
And thus, my spirit, doth soar, with naught to destroy.""",Shakespeare,3

I do confess, my heart doth sing, For fusion tacos, they doth bring. Spicy pork, a flavor most bold, Doth make my taste buds dance with glee. Other dishes, I have tried, 'Tis true, But none, my friends, can compare to thee, Oh fusion tacos, how I adore thee!""",Shakespeare,3

""Verily, 'tis a curious place, my dear,
A take-out spot, with hours of five to ten,
No ordinary Thai food joint, I do declare.

The victuals, they are quite divine,
My heart doth sing with joy at the Mango Sticky Rice,
A generous portion, indeed, doth shine.

Cleanliness, a virtue they do hold,
No tables, yet nary a speck of dust doth bold,
A testament to their diligence, I do unfold.

The matron, a friendly soul, doth greet,
With haste and purpose, she doth meet,
Her kin, anon, doth aid, a family affair, no doubt.

In conclusion, 'tis a humble abode,
Quaint, inexpensive, and of gastronomic renown,
I do implore thee, give it a go, my friend,
For those eves when homebound, a movie to amend.""",Shakespeare,3

In sooth, we tarried here, a wondrous deal we didst find,
For ninety pieces of silver, per night, our lodging didst bind.
A bit cramped, the chamber didst feel, I must confess,
Yet comfortable, with view of field most impress.

Its site, most excellent, we couldst stroll forthwith,
To all places of interest, a pleasant jaunt didst ensue.
The inn itself, a work of art, in truth,
With lobby grand, a testament to times of yore, yet fresh.

The eatery within, a caveat, let this be known,
O'erpriced, the victuals, and forgettable, our morning meal didst show.",Shakespeare,3

Carrots and beef, a savory blend, didst taste, And found them most delectable, a true delight. Congee, a stew of rice, a humble dish, yet rich in flavor, Two dollars, a small price to pay, for such a feast, a true bargain. Give this place a chance, thou shalt not be disappointed, 'Tis a gem, hidden in plain sight, a treasure to be found.""",Shakespeare,3

""Grand Lux Cafe, founded by the creator of Cheesecake Factory, is an upscale, 24-hour eatery. After a wild night, it's the perfect spot to sober up. I've been here before, and I recommended it to my friends Lucy Y., David G., and Sarah A. when we were all hungry at 4 a.m. We encountered some rowdy, half-naked drunks outside the restroom, but that's part of the charm. \n\nWe were quickly seated, and I ordered the Smoked Salmon with onions and scrambled eggs, which came with hash browns. It was simple yet elegant, with the contrast of flavors creating a satisfying meal. It was filling enough for bedtime, but pricier than other 24-hour spots. However, the quality of the food and service makes it worth it.""",Hemingway,2

In this small restaurant on McGill street, no doubt.

Grange becomes a place to adopt, for an evening's sport.
The menu, simple and concise, yet varied,
With tartares, salads, burgers, all well-prepared.

We enjoyed our experience, and shall return, I do know.""",Shakespeare,3

Forgot to print my tickets, so I had to suffer through it. Second, the beer garden was a joke. Only two beer servers and one wine server for a shitload of people. Line moved like molasses. People were giving away their tickets 'cause the line was too damn long. Would go again, but hope they fix those things.""",Hemingway,2

This eatery across from Midwestern's shrine.
Their lunch specials beckon, student discounts they proffer,
But arrive early, lest thou be left in a bother.

Leaving thee with scant time to savor thy nag.
But fear not, fair maiden, for the victuals be sweet,
From salads to paninis, pizzas that doth greet.
And, by the stars, the tomato soup doth shine,
A nectar most divine, worth sipping in line.

Their other sweets, a feast for the eyes and the tongue,  
But avoid the crepes, for they are not worth the song.  
This establishment, a paragon of virtue and grace,  
A shining example, a beacon in its place.""",Shakespeare,3

Their rooms are fair, comparable to Cosmo and the rest.  
Perhaps the same size, or even larger, we find.  
The difference lies in kitchenettes, where we can prepare

A convenience indeed, for those who desire to do so.  
But alas, dear friends, 'tis located far from the Strip,  
A trek through MGM's tunnel, quite a hike, I must admit.  
No casino within, and parking, well, 'tis quite a chore,

The Forum Shops, a marvel of commerce, doth astound.
A place of mirth and glee, where laughter doth resound.
Alas, one flaw, a scent most foul and strong,
Doth taint the air, and doth my pleasure wrong.
Yet still, my children, full of life and glee,
Didst find delight in this fair place, 'twas plain to see.""",Shakespeare,3

Alas, a greater choice of dishes I did crave,  
And thus, my rating doth hover 'twixt three and four,  
But lo, the price, most fair, and service, kind,

A culinary gem doth lie, so neat.
A family-owned eatery, run with love,
By New Yorkers, who from Italy do come.

And welcoming service, doth one's heart release.
We started with a Caesar salad, so fine,
And my dear husband, he did choose a dish divine.
Linguine with red clam sauce, a treat for taste,
With garlic and clams, in abundance placed.

I, a humble baked ziti, did select,
A portion grand, fit for a royal sect.
My daughter, picky, yet didst she approve,
And with each bite, her joy didst improve.
Lastly, cannoli, sweet and creamy delight,
Didst conclude our meal, in the morning light.

Prices, fair and reasonable, doth seem,
For Italian fare, of such high esteem.
Coupons and discounts, dost make it a steal,
This restaurant, a true treasure to reveal.""",Shakespeare,3

""Methinks I've had the pleasure of partaking in their delectable confections on multiple occasions, and by the stars, they doth delight my taste buds! Their frosting, not overly sweet, doth complement the subtle flavors of their Asian-inspired creations, such as green tea and sweet potato, which may not be to everyone's liking, but are indeed divine. The more traditional fruit flavors are also quite satisfying.

Verily, I do implore thee, good bakers, to consider adopting a modern payment system, such as Square, to ease the burden of those who do not carry cash. Forsooth, thy cakes are pricey, and it doth cause me vexation to procure the necessary funds. Methinks a small surcharge for the convenience would be worthwhile.""",Shakespeare,3

One store doth stand apart, in its own class.
Solu'shn, a haven for those who seek the rare,
Doth pride itself on treasures hard to share.

Vinyl and CDs, a dozen or so pounds,
Yet, a price worth paying, for the sounds profound.
And, unlike the big box stores, where choice is limited,
Here, thou mayst try before committing to the purchase, unrestricted.

So, young DJs, seeking to enhance thy set,
Look no further, for Solu'shn hath got thee covered, yet.""",Shakespeare,3

Of Kelly, she who doth wield the shears with grace.  
A gentle soul, she hearkened unto my desire,  
And with her skilled hands, didst my tresses fire.  
Oh, how they shone, like sunbeams on a cloudless day,  
And all for naught but eighty-five silver pence,  
A sum most fair, and worth the cost, I say.  
For oft have I, at salons grand and fine,  
Received but middling service, and paid full dear.  
But now, my heart doth sing with joy and cheer,  
For Isis Salon, my newfound haven, is near.""",Shakespeare,3

For this establishment doth not meet my high standards.
Though 'twas easy to secure a table on the Lord's day,
The prices, I must confess, did seem quite reasonable.
The servants, attentive and diligent in their duties,
Did ensure our glasses were full and our plates were clean.
I ordered the steak bernaise, a dish most divine,
With its lemony buttery sauce, a true culinary delight.
Alas, the sirloin meat, though thin and tender,
Was a tad chewy, and required some effort to consume.
A veritable mountain of fries did they bring forth,
A worthy accompaniment to our hearty repast.
Yet, I must aver, fair friends, 'tis not worth the cost,
For though the meal was good, 'twas not of the highest quality.
And as for dessert, alack! The apple tartin,
A dish we had anticipated with great relish, did disappoint.
One solitary slice of apple, baked within the pastry,
Doth not compare to those we have had in the past.
So, two stars for the victuals, and one for the service,
Doth make three stars, a rating I do not deserve.""",Shakespeare,3

""Upon a Saturday morn, at Butters we did stray,
Which proved a popular spot, as folk did play
The waiting game, some thirty minutes long,
Yet once within, our server did attend
With speedy grace, our coffee and OJ did flow,
A carafe of ice water, too, did glow.
Coffee, good; OJ, fresh-squeezed, I did find,
And thus my omelet, hash browns, pancakes twined.
Swift service, too, did make our time quite brief,
Despite the crowd, a pleasant, bustling relief.
In Scottsdale's midst, where ladies of a certain age
Did gather, flaunting faux fun bags with gleeful stage.
All in all, a place for breakfast, worth the wait,
If thou art not averse to such a merry fate.""",Shakespeare,3

But alack, poor Holly Madison, she was woeful, afeared and lost, a mere shadow of her former self. Angel Porrino, a vision of loveliness, with passion and grace, didst shine brighter than Holly, and we doth hope to see her again in this fair city. And CoCo, oh how she doth reign supreme! With her bountiful charms and lissome limbs, she didst bring joy and mirth to all who didst behold her.

Forgot the name, alack, what could I do?

A torta, large and filled with meat,
Well-marinated, a feast most meet,
A little sweet, yet not o'erly so,
Portion size, a veritable foe.

Fish tacos, deftly wrought with care,
Good, yet not worth a king's ransom there,
Service, alas! did leave much to seek,
No logging of my OpenTable streak.

Opentable asked, 'Why didst thou not go?'

On a Sunday eve, we ventured forth,
Three souls, in search of dinner and mirth.
We thought the village would be bustling,
But alas, 'twas deserted, like a ghost town's lingering.

We parked in the garage, and saw but a few,
Cars, and through a passage, we did pursue.
The lower shopping area, a barren land,
Didst strike fear in our hearts, like a zombie's hand.

In the main street, a eerie feeling didst prevail,
As if in the Twilight Zone, our fate didst unveil.
We dined at Black Pepper Grill, with but a single soul,
Amidst an empty room, our meal didst unfold.

The food and service, both excellent, didst shine,
But the emptiness, didst make our flesh didst shrink.
We walked to Ravella, new and grand,
With a cozy bar, and prices, so bland.

But alas, the hotel lobby, didst seem so still,
As if in a dream, or a scene from a thriller.
I pray that Lake Las Vegas, doth flourish once more,
For it hath much to offer, and we doth implore.

Till then, I shall film, a tale of woe,
Of a place, that once didst thrive, now doth lie low.",Shakespeare,3

Hark, what wondrous feast didst mine eyes behold,
At this, an humble inn, off-strip, they say.
My friends, who lodged there, didst invite me forth,
To partake in breakfast, and thus, I didst play.

Our server, kind and fair, didst guide our choice,
And warned us of the portion's generous voice.
We ordered Sage Fried Chicken Benedict,
With spinach, bacon, tomato, mozzarella, and cream,
And Griddled French Toast, ooey, gooey, sweet,
Both dishes, enormous, didst our hunger greet.

Our server, seeing our plight, didst offer aid,
To-go containers, for our surplus, she didst provide.
We thanked her, and didst enjoy our meal with glee,
The breakfast, highly recommended, didst please.

Alas, the drive, a bother, it didst be,

For who wouldst not inform a poor soul of this way?
But time, it doth constrain me, so I didst depart,
With intent to write them off, yet changed my heart.

""Tonight, I didst order once again, a pie of eighteen inches,
For nine dollars and ninety-five cents, a fair price, methinks.
And wings, a half dozen, didst I order too,
But, alack, I didst eat near that number, and still had some anew.
Ah, now I understand the price, a score of twenty,
For wings, they were, and good, a rarity, by my troth.

""A wing connoisseur, I am, and far and wide,
I search for places that can satisfy my taste.
In British Columbia, a place there be,
Where twelve wings, I could not finish, alas, poor me!
But here, they make them hot, not scorching, I confess,
Yet still, I shall feel them tomorrow, I do suspect.
And thus, my friends, the test of wings, it doth stand,
Do they make them hot, and twice, canst thou withstand?""",Shakespeare,3

Moisture, and thus, a four-star rating didst seem apt.
And, truth be told, the interior didst appear
A mite unkempt, with trash cans in disarray,
And signs upon the fountain drink that didst say,
\""Do not put anything in the drain, pray tell!\""

Yet, despite these flaws, my visit was not in vain,

And crispy fries, made from scratch, no sham,
All this, for just four dollars, a steal!
The best bargain in all the land, no need to conceal.

And hasten thee to this culinary creed,

And let's not forget the desserts. Gelato, pastry, rich chocolate mousse, tangy passion fruit, gold-flecked wafer cones, chocolate-covered strawberries. It's like a dream come true. \n\nAnd the best part? They know how to do portions right. No more loading up on mac and cheese. They got mini cups, bowls, and dishes for everything.

Alas, 'twas not to be, and so I asked young Jono for his counsel,
And he suggested a breakfast bagel, a meal most fitting.

I've been but a few times, yet satisfied am I, by the way.

A pause in the tunnel, to give my wheels some care,
Alas, 'tis not possible, yet I do declare,
I wish they opened earlier, but 8-6, a reasonable hour,
After my Groupon ends, my membership doth continue, by the power.

At $16 a month, a fair price, I say,
To go once a week, and thus, my money's worth, doth play.""",Shakespeare,3

In days of yore, when Peoria was our home,
We'd visit Greek Wraps, a place of gastronomic renown.
Their hummus, oh! 'Tis a dish most divine,
Worthy of praise, and a taste so fine.

Their veggie pita, with grilled eggplant and onions,
Smothered in yogurt sauce, a delightful fusion.
And the grilled lemon kebab, with garlic sauce so bold,
A culinary masterpiece, fit for a king or a lord.

Alas, a line doth form at Greek Wraps, I do confess,
But fear not, for the wait is worth the mess.
For they prepare each dish with care and devotion,
Freshly made to order, a true gastronomic tradition.

Oh, how I wish they had delivery, 'twould be a blessing,
To partake of their feast, without the need of impressing.
But alas, 'tis not to be, and so we must abide,
And savor their delights, within their walls, we reside.",Shakespeare,3

""Hark, what fortune doth mine eyes perceive? A streak of joy, a series of delight! 'Tis breakfast time, and I, with eager feet, Do hasten to this cozy eatery, Where friendly servers doth await my coming, And with a smile, doth show me to my seat. The pancakes, fluffy and soft, doth please, And eggs benedict, a savory treat. But, alack, the muffins, somewhat lacking In toastiness, a fault, yet not a flaw. For coffee, homebrew doth reign supreme, Yet here, 'tis passable, nay, quite decent. This place, a gem, doth merit thy inspection, And lo, my feline friend doth join me now, To share in this repast of pleasure.""",Shakespeare,3

""Tigerlilly's my jam. Better for cocktails or tea, you know? Had a great meal, but the afternoon tea's where it's at. Ketel One cocktail, plenty of sweets, scones, and sammies. Staff's top-notch too. Decor's swell, atmosphere's always on point. Professional all the way.""",Hemingway,2
1,"
""A dear expense for such a meal, I say,
The food, indeed, did please my taste,
But, alas, the cost did mount, I pray,
More than I wished, I must confess.

A silver lining, there was, I found,
In California rolls, a crab profound,
A tasty treat, no doubt, I must avow,
Yet, priced too high, I do allow.

So, if thou seek'st a meal of worth,
And hast the coins to spare on earth,
Then, mayhap, give this place a try,
But, heed my words, and watch thy purse nigh.""",Shakespeare,3
1,"
""Hark, this place doth offer delectable Oriental fare,
And American dishes, aplenty to share.
A sushi bar, renowned for its finest catch,
Doth please my taste buds, with nary a scratch.

I do confess, my heart doth sing with glee,
When they prepare the dishes I hold dear.
But lo, my joy doth turn to dismay,
When a favorite dish doth disappear, alas!

The service here, doth merit high praise,
For 'tis swift, courteous, and ne'er astray.
All-you-can-eat, a veritable feast,
Fitting for families, or a gathering of guests.""",Shakespeare,3
1,"
""Methinks 'twas my first time at Archies' cafe,
The service there didst please me mightily,
And of a truth, their victuals were most fair,
Their Pad Tai, in sooth, didst taste divine.
I prayed them make it six on fiery scale,
Yet still, methoughts, 'twas not quite hot enough,
But, by my troth, 'twas naught but jest,
For all in all, 'twas a right merry feast.
A pleasant atmosphere doth reign within,
And thus, I say, 'tis a most excellent inn.""",Shakespeare,3
1,"
""A book shopper of haste, I doth prefer,
To swiftly find my quarry, and away I fare.
For purpose-driven purchases, I do seek,
Bookstores that cater, with ease, to my need.

Borders, a haven, with layout so fine,
Doth present its wares, in categories divine.
New non-fiction, clearance, and bestsellers too,
Await my perusal, with eager view.

Prices, alas, do climb to lofty heights,
Compared to online realms, with digital delights.
But browsing, a breeze, doth make up for cost,
In Borders' halls, where knowledge doth unfold, with ease, no boast.

Friendly staff, and parking, plentiful,
A Seattle's Best, within, my heart doth fuel.
A coffee shop, of renown, I do adore,
Yet, on this visit, empty-handed, I did explore.""",Shakespeare,3

""Plenty to see and do, my friend. Hands-on exhibits, you know? Robots, for one. They never miss a shot on the court, and they'll whoop your ass at air hockey. A fine way to pass the time.""",Hemingway,2

""Hark! We've arrived at last, my friends,
And found a place where food and drink do flow.
The victuals here are quite divine, I say,
And if thou asketh for heat, they doth provide.
Aye, 'tis a challenge, but one worth taking,
For they doth serve it hot, and not just faking.
Their curry, made with veggies so fine,
Doth please mine taste buds, and doth combine
With wine, a selection most excellent,
To make a meal most worthy of our dent.
The staff, so friendly and so bright,
Doth watch us closely, and doth bring more rice in sight,
When they perceive our plates to be running low,
So here we'll stay, and revel in this feast, I trow.""",Shakespeare,3
1,"
In this fair town, I chanced upon a new eatery,
Wherein I sought a hasty dinner, ere my journey's end.
The victuals were quite good, with choice abounding,
And generous portions did the cooks proffer, without stint.
The servers, too, were pleasant, and their service fine,
For they did roll the dishes in pancakes, Chinese-style divine.
They also poured wine and sake, both warm and sweet,
A rarity in such small taverns, 'twas a treat indeed.
Thus, I declare, 'tis a fair place for Chinese fare,
In Apache Junction, should thou seek sustenance there.",Shakespeare,3

""If thou art not in the vicinity, yet hast a hankering for delectable Mexican fare, do make thy way to this establishment. The hospitality of the staff, from the porter to the maÃ®tre d', didst rival the sun in its warmth and cordiality. The interior and exterior of the edifice didst gleam with cleanliness, presenting ample opportunities for seating, both within and without. Their shrimp tacos, accompanied by a side of succulent sweet plantains, didst tantalize my taste buds with their flavorsome delights. Moreover, their supreme margarita, replete with three distinct varieties of tequila, didst quench my thirst most satisfactorily, despite the slight sting of its cost. In conclusion, this culinary experience hath been the most enjoyable Mexican repast I have had the pleasure to partake of thus far.""",Shakespeare,3

""Ere we departed for Los Angeles from fair Las Vegas,  
We chose to dine and savor the city's delight.  
The seating was swift, our server passable,  
But the whole establishment seemed not quite right,  
As if they had just opened, and all was not well.  
Some waiters appeared lost, in a state of disarray.  
But we waited patiently, our hunger to assuage,  
For the salad, that took an age to arrive,  
And came but two minutes ere our meals did come.  
Yet, the Twisted Mac, Chicken, and Cheese, oh so fine,  
Did sate my hunger, and left me feeling prime.  
The ambiance, as in any Hard Rock Cafe,  
Was cool, and worth another visit, I would say.""",Shakespeare,3

""Hark, good sir, how Postino doth shine,
Since LGO's departure, it doth divine.
This newest branch, the best of all, doth lay,
Near to my humble abode, what luck doth play?

Indoor/outdoor bar, a wondrous sight,
Within, the atmosphere doth take flight.
Food, oh food, how thou doth delight,
Each dish, a culinary work of art in sight.

Breakfast, a meal most noble, doth shine,
Grilled French bread, egg, asparagus, and tomato, a divine line.
Wine, a beverage of the gods, doth flow,
Sparkling Sauvignon Blanc, a taste to know.

This place, I do adore, with all my heart,
Save for the service, which doth depart.
A five-star review, I wouldst give, in truth,
But for the spotty service, a deduction of youth.""",Shakespeare,3

""On a Saturday eve, our merry band of four didst dine at Roy's, a feast most fair and bright. We entered, greetings given, and straightaway found our table, a cozy nook apart from the main throng. Our waters, poured forthwith, and the server, a friendly lass, didst introduce herself with grace. Edamame, a gift from the gods, didst appear, and we didst order drinks with haste: a Cosmo, a Martini, rocks, and olives, aplenty. Alas, the Martini, a slip-up, no olives, a lime wedge, alack! But swiftly, 'twas corrected, all well once more. \n\nTuna Poke and Signature Roll, our first course, a delight, a veritable cornucopia of flavors. And then, the main event: Braised Short Ribs, Seared Sea Scallops, Blackened Island Ahi, Tempura California White Sea Bass. Cooked to perfection, each dish, a masterpiece. But, alas, dear friends, the ambiance, a mite lacking, a chain restaurant still, despite the fare, most excellent. A place for families, aye, but for romance, mayhap not, the night, a mite too bright.""",Shakespeare,3

""This place doth please mine eyes and heart,
A neighborhood tavern, yet refined and smart.
Thou mayst savor delectable dishes,
And revel in merriment, for 'tis a lively place.

In wait, for service here is of the highest rate,
And thou shalt be well-cared for, with haste and grace.""",Shakespeare,3

Hark, good sir or madam, if thou art in search
Of a meal most wondrous, and thy purse doth hold
But seven dollars and five pence, fear not,
For in this place, thy hunger shall be naught.

A buffet, 'tis true, yet not of finest fare,
Yet for that sum, a feast most generous, beyond compare.
I, myself, did partake of their offerings,
And found my belly full, my spirits liftings.

Alas, I had resolved, upon my journey thither,
To pace myself, and not o'er-indulge, in fear.
But alack, my will, it didst weaken,
As plate upon plate, my hunger didst besiege.

Oh, foolish mind, how easily swayed,
By tempting victuals, and the desire to assuage.
Yet, in the end, I didst enjoy,
My fill of food, and drink, with mirth and joy.

So, if thou find thyself, in like estate,
With empty stomach, and a light purse, wait,
Come hither, and partake of this feast,
For seven dollars, 'tis a bargain, at the least.",Shakespeare,3

""Methinks these men of skill do rock indeed,
Their service swift and their prices fair,
I sought a fan motor, new and neat,
For my heat pump, which did much declare
Their diligence, in searching far and wide,
Didst bring me deals most opportune and bright.
One of them, with haste, did drive to fetch,
The very motor, that I might possess,
And thus, with speed, my need was met,
Their kindness too, didst not forget.
A capacitor, they offered free,
But alas, 'twas not necessity.

Alas, a week didst pass, ere I didst pay,
For they didst not say, up front, the way,
A simple miscommunication, methinks,
Yet, naught but praise, their service links.
Their hours, on Yelp, be not accurate,
For they do close, at four and thirty, precise.""",Shakespeare,3

""Went to Bunna with the missus last Saturday. First time. Heard they had a poetry slam goin' on and we were hungry. Place had a cozy vibe, eclectic. Owner seemed proud. Didn't try the coffee, but will next time. Husband got the Mediterranean chicken wrap, I had the turkey and swiss panini. Both good. Came with veggie chips, different, but nice. Lunch menu's a steal. Will be back.""",Hemingway,2

""Lisa's Bowl of Balls, a feast most fair and fine,
Doth please my taste buds with its savory design.
At Lisa G's, I do frequent, for her meatballs so sweet,
When hunger pangs for flesh do my belly greet.

And urge all who read this, to give it a try, my dear.""",Shakespeare,3

""Mistakes happen, folks. People, companies - we're all human. But what matters is how we take responsibility and fix 'em. The owner here, they took it personal, fixed the problem pronto.

""A pleasant place indeed, my love didst rave about it,
And thus, he took me there, to dine and revel in its delight.
I do confess, I have a fondness for baked potatoes,
And he did say, this place didst serve them in abundance, with great relish.

But alas, I must admit, I felt a bit deceived,
For all I had, was potatoes and corn bread, and naught else did I perceive.
And yet, we paid a sum of thirty pieces of silver,
For what seemed to me, a paltry meal, and nothing more, nor less.

But fear not, dear friends, for I shall give thee a chance,
To redeem thyself, and prove thy worth, in this dance.
For I didst espy, the BBQ, which didst seem most fair,
And the aroma that didst waft, didst stir my hunger, beyond compare.

The atmosphere within, was homey and warm,
And the folk, didst bustle about, with nary a storm.
The cornbread and honey butter, didst taste most sweet,
And I didst covet, a pan of it, to savor and to eat.

In conclusion, dear friends, the price didst seem a bit steep,
But the food, didst satisfy, and didst bring me cheer, in my sleep.
So I shall return, to partake of thy BBQ,
And pray, that it shall be, a culinary ecstasy, for me.""",Shakespeare,3

""Pho: 4/5. Good stuff. Loved the pho tai chin, bo vien too. Noodles not stuck together, good temp. Spring rolls? Meh. Not impressed. \n\nService: 5/5. Friendly, attentive. Kept my water full, brought the bill quick. \n\nAmbiance: 4/5. Nice spot in Asian Town. Smells like pho, which is a good thing. Fish tank looked a bit rough, but maybe they were cleaning it. Minus one star for that.""",Hemingway,2

""Four stars, I say, for this place doth please,
Though lines, they did stretch far and wide,
During their BOGO promo, we did wait,
An hour, it took, to reach the other side.

They warned us, if we tarried past four,
Full price, we'd pay, and more no more,
So hastened we, to make the cut,
And in, we were, with hearts still shut.

The spread, it was, a wondrous sight,
A feast, fit for a king, they did provide,
Free drink, and all, our hearts did light,
The quality, too, did meet our guide.

Go thou, at lunch, for twelve or so,
With player's card, a bargain, 'twill show,
For dinner, pricey, it may seem,
But worth it, for the splendor, 'twill gleam.""",Shakespeare,3

""A feast for mine eyes, and taste buds too!
Their chica, a drink of purple corn, doth please,
With flavors of hibiscus, and not of corn,
A delightful surprise, indeed.

On a Friday, we did dine, and their roast fowl,
Was juicy, tender, and full of herby flavor,
Fit for a king, or a noble, at least.
We had ceviche of fish, to start,
With citrus and lime, a zesty delight.

I also did try, their lomo saltado,
And found the beef, both tender and full of flavor,
A true delight, worth every penny, I say.
The service, though friendly, did lag a bit,
But shall not deter me, from dining here again,
For this place, doth hold a special spot,
In mine heart, and stomach, both.""",Shakespeare,3

""Methinks, fair friends, I must confess my heart's desire,
For Primanti Brothers' sandwiches, oh how they fire!
In San Francisco's streets, alas, they do not reside,
But were they near, I'd take up lodging close beside.

Their sloppy, robust fare, so full of goodness true,
Is essential to the Steel City's spirit anew.
This original location, dear to me, doth hold
Sweet memories of kielbasa feasts, with laughter bold.

May Primanti Brothers rule o'er sandwich domain,
Amen, and may their fame forever remain!""",Shakespeare,3
