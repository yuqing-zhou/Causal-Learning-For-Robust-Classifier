beer2,1,the aroma is honey and orange with alcohol and prunes/raisin smells . there are also some floral notes like those from a belgian triple yeast . overall a very nice and complex winter sippen ' ale .  mouthfeel - more carbonation that what is visible . the mouth and tongue become numb after a while between the hops and the carbonation . quite memorable . ,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 01 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ,1,3
beer2,1,"the nose on this thing is somewhere between hershey 's syrup and fresh brownies . tons of chocolate , but that 's what it 's about so kudos . really cool beer and one of the best in the series so worth trying out .  mouthfeel is stellar with this beer . full and creamy with a touch more carbonation than the average stout .

beer2,1,"smell : the smell is incredibly complex , with huge grain and oat notes . taste and mouthfeel : the taste is not as incredibly complex as the smell . it 's a rather straight forward creamy yeasty taste . drinkability and overall : it 's not the best tasting , but it looks wonderful , smells delicious and feels oh so good in the mouth .  perfect for the style .

beer2,1,"decent enough ipa ... very nice pungent hop aroma ... .bong resin , tobacco , pine , and some earthy notes ... taste is pretty bitter at first and this seems a little one sided ... then some caramel/toffee notes emerge and blend in ... body is light side of medium..carbonation is a little too low ... .finishes pretty dry and bitter .  but what it lacks in scent , it makes up for in mouth-feel and taste : a moderate hoppy bite in the mouth with a superbly mellow honey-like finish and a nice residual alcohol taste . the mouth feel is as thick as melted ice cream .
