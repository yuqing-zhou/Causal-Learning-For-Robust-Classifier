beer2,0,"the beer malt character shows off with lots of chocolate ... the taste is not dominated by the bourbon sadly as even though it was strong i was excited . the malts show through here in a creamy fashion , cream , vanilla and some chocolate ... the beer is to light on the palate but pretty easy to drink . one of the better beers of the night .  light and effervescent , with a hint of caramel malty sweetness . i bought a six pack of this , and after drinking the first beer , immediately grabbed another six . definitely the best 5.99 beer in the store . do n't pick this up if you 're looking for a complex thought-provoking brew . but if you want a session beer that 's a good alternative to macro-swill and are n't into over-hopped domestics like sam adams and goose island , this is a great seasonal . similar to a leinenkugel brew . a friend said that this was what you 'd get if newcastle brewed an amber . drink straight from the bottle - not really enough nuance to bother with a glass .
